2,0,Explain the difference between imperative and declarative programming. Add example on javascript,"ChatGPTCertainly! Imperative and declarative programming are two different paradigms in programming that describe how you instruct a computer to perform tasks. Here's an explanation of each with JavaScript examples:Imperative Programming:Imperative programming is focused on specifying the exact steps that the computer should take to achieve a desired outcome.It emphasizes ""how"" to perform a task, often involving detailed instructions and control flow.Developers have to manage mutable state and often use loops and conditional statements.Example in JavaScript:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Declarative Programming:Declarative programming, on the other hand, focuses on describing ""what"" you want to achieve rather than specifying the step-by-step process.It's more concise and abstract, often relying on functions and expressions to manipulate data.Declarative code is often easier to read and understand.Example in JavaScript:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In the declarative example, we use the reduce method to specify what we want to do (summing an array) without detailing how it should be done. This makes the code more concise and easier to maintain, as you don't have to worry about managing state or iterating through the array manually.In summary, imperative programming is about describing the step-by-step procedure to achieve a task, while declarative programming focuses on expressing the desired outcome without specifying the exact process.",OPEN,https://github.com/magnifiq/js-practice-vention/pull/9,https://github.com/magnifiq/js-practice-vention/pull/9#discussion_r1353282723,reviews.body,"Too imperative.

Base64 encoding is a method for converting binary data into a safe string format that can be easily transmitted or stored without worrying about special characters or other issues that can arise with binary data.When you Base64-encode an empty string, you simply get another empty string as the result. Similarly, when you decode an empty Base64 string, the output is an empty string.However, it's important to note that the context matters. If you're expecting a Base64-encoded value and you receive an empty string, it might mean that there's no data available or that something went wrong in the data transmission or generation process.

is it possible a user could import some function from an default python library that allows execution of arbitrary code?","ChatGPTYes, if a system allows users to specify a string that represents the path to a function to import and execute, there are potential security risks, especially if the range of acceptable modules or functions is not explicitly whitelisted.Python's standard library contains many modules and functions that could potentially be harmful if executed with the wrong arguments or in the wrong context. Here are just a few examples:os.system: This function can execute arbitrary system commands. If a user imports and runs this with a malicious command string, it could lead to data corruption, theft, or other harmful actions.subprocess: Similar to os.system, the subprocess module can be used to run system commands.shutil: Contains functions that can be used for file and directory operations, which can be abused for destructive actions.Modules like pickle can lead to arbitrary code execution if used to deserialize untrusted data.Given the current implementation of your import_function, a malicious user could potentially specify any of the above or others to cause harm.To mitigate these risks:Whitelist Modules/Functions: Only allow specific modules or functions that are known to be safe. This can be achieved by having a list of allowed modules/functions and checking against this list before importing.Do not Allow Dynamic Import: If possible, avoid allowing users to specify functions to import dynamically. Instead, provide a predefined set of functionalities they can choose from.Input Validation: Always validate user input. Ensure that it adheres to expected patterns and doesn't contain unexpected characters or sequences.Run in a Sandbox: If you must allow dynamic code execution, consider running the code in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage.Logging and Monitoring: Keep detailed logs of user activities, especially around dynamic code execution. Monitor for suspicious activity.Remember that security is a multi-layered approach, and there's rarely a single solution to ensure complete safety.

7,0,"I'm building an app that tracks screentime.

We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.

To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events (splitting on spaces and other word boundaries). However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that (almost) always occur together.

How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings (by duration, not count) such that it will include longer common strings?

Here is some code for how it's currently done:

```typescript
      const words = {};
      for (const event of events) {
        const words_in_event = event.data.title.split(/[\s\-,:()[\]/]/);
        for (const word of words_in_event) {
          if (word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includes(word)) {
            continue;
          }
          if (word in words) {
            words[word].duration += event.duration;
            words[word].events.push(event);
          } else {
            words[word] = {
              word: word,
              duration: event.duration,
              events: [event],

          }
        }
      }
```","ChatGPTThe code you have shared splits the event title into single words and counts the duration of each word occurrence. To capture longer common strings, you might consider implementing N-grams. An N-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech.

You might want to implement this with varying lengths of N depending on your specific needs.[CODE_BLOCK_0]You might also consider using libraries such as Natural, which is a general natural language facility for Node.js, or franc-min, which is a library to detect the language of text. They might simplify your work, especially when working with N-grams or language detection.Please note that the larger the N-gram, the more memory you will consume, and the more computationally expensive the process becomes.

9,0,"While developing the WordPress plugin, should you internally use the shortcode as do_shortcode('[my_shortcode]'), is this a good practice?","ChatGPTUsing do_shortcode('[my_shortcode]') within your WordPress plugin code is generally not considered a good practice. While it can be a quick and simple way to execute a shortcode and get its output, it can lead to various issues and is not the recommended approach for several reasons:Performance: Calling do_shortcode() directly can have a performance impact because it processes the content and searches for shortcodes every time it's called. If your shortcode is simple and doesn't have any dynamic content or complex logic, this might not be a significant issue. However, for complex shortcodes or when they are used frequently, this can slow down your site.Lack of Context: When you use do_shortcode(), it executes the shortcode without the context of where it's called. Shortcodes are designed to be used within the post content or widgets, where they have access to post-related data. If you use do_shortcode() in your plugin code, it might not have access to the necessary context, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.Error Handling: Shortcodes may return errors or produce unexpected output. When using do_shortcode(), it can be challenging to handle these errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users or log them for debugging purposes.Lack of Flexibility: If you need to modify the behavior of your shortcode or add additional parameters or functionality, it's easier to do so by directly integrating the shortcode functionality into your plugin rather than relying on do_shortcode().Instead of using do_shortcode(), consider the following best practices:Function Integration: Implement the functionality of your shortcode directly within your plugin using PHP functions. This allows you to have more control over the execution and behavior of your shortcode.Use WordPress Hooks: You can use WordPress action hooks or filters to execute your code at the appropriate points in the WordPress lifecycle. This allows you to integrate your plugin's functionality seamlessly into the WordPress environment.Shortcode API: If you want to provide a shortcode for users to use in post content, register it using the Shortcode API provided by WordPress.

**Description**:
The proposed changes introduce Xef, a speculated programming language primarily focused on AI interactions. Xef aims to integrate AI prompts within a programming paradigm seamlessly.

**Features**:

1. **AI-Prompts as First-Class Entities**:
   
   In the Xef language, system, assistant, and user interactions are embedded within the primary syntax, ensuring AI interactions are inherent to the language structure.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     system: ""How can I assist you today?""
     user: ""I'd like to know more about Xef.""
     assistant: ""Xef is a programming language focused on AI interactions.""
   ```

2. **Modular Design**:
   
   Xef modules are version-controlled, can be imported, and reused, making the language modular and scalable.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     version: 1.0.0
     imports: [ExternalModule]
   ```

3. **JVM Integration**:
   
   Xef can interact with JVM through a simplified import mechanism, allowing for seamless integration of existing JVM libraries.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     jvm: import com.example.LibraryFunction as LibraryFunction
   ```

4. **Concise Control Structures**:
   
   Control structures such as loops and conditional statements are presented in an intuitive and concise manner.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     if isHappy(userMood): 
        assistant: ""Glad to hear that!""
     else: 
        assistant: ""How can I help you feel better?""
   ```

5. **Dynamic Inference Mechanism**:
   
   Users can utilize placeholders for inferences, offering a way for dynamic interactions with the AI model.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     assistant:
       infer provide_advice:
         moodContext: ""sad""
   ```

6. **Argument System with Typing**:
   
   Modules can accept arguments, and with the dependent typing mechanism, these arguments can have both value and shape constraints.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     arguments:
       userName: String
       mood: ['happy', 'sad', 'neutral']
   ```

7. **Localization through Mapping**:
   
   The remapping feature facilitates the adaptation of Xef's syntax to linguistic preferences, illustrated with a Spanish example.
   
   ```yaml
   ai:
     version: 1.0.0
     imports: [SpanishMappingModule]
   ```

We should not be able to delete data from the pwn.college server.


On s3, how can I define my data retention policy for my database backups","ChatGPTBased on your backup stats and needs, it's clear that you're generating a significant amount of data annually. Since you cannot delete data from the pwn.college server, you'll need a robust retention policy that maximizes space while ensuring data availability and integrity.Here's a proposed retention policy using Amazon S3:Short-Term Backups (for operational recovery):Daily Backups: Retain daily backups for 30 days. This means that you'll have a backup for every day in the past month.Rationale: If there's a need to restore from a recent backup (due to data corruption, human error, or other issues), you have a backup from each day to choose from.Medium-Term Backups (for slightly older data):Weekly Backups: After the first 30 days, retain a weekly backup for the next 3 months (12 weeks).Rationale: This allows you to minimize storage while still having relatively recent backups available if needed. Weekly backups are suitable for issues that may not have been immediately recognized.Long-Term Backups (for archival and compliance):Monthly Backups: After the initial 4 months (30 days + 3 months), retain a monthly backup for the rest of the year (8 months).Rationale: This drastically reduces storage costs while preserving a good historical record of your data.Implementing in Amazon S3 using Lifecycle Policies:Create a bucket or use your existing backup bucket in S3.Under ""Management"" for your bucket, navigate to ""Lifecycle Policies.""Create a new policy:Daily Backups: Set up a transition action for backups older than 30 days to move to STANDARD_IA (Infrequent Access) storage for cost savings. Simultaneously, set an expiration action to delete these after 120 days (30 days + 90 days from medium-term).Weekly Backups: After 120 days, your daily backups would have been deleted, leaving only the weekly ones. Transition these to GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE after 210 days (30 + 90 + 90 days).Monthly Backups: These backups should be retained indefinitely or as long as your retention policy demands. They will be in cheaper storage classes (GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE) to save on storage costs.Ensure that versioning is turned off if you don't need to keep multiple versions of the same file. This can also save storage costs.Remember, S3 storage costs depend on the storage class you choose. The STANDARD_IA, GLACIER, and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are designed for long-term storage and backups, and they are cheaper than the STANDARD class but come with a slightly higher retrieval time/cost.Lastly, always test your backup and recovery process to ensure it meets your needs and expectations.",OPEN,https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo/pull/219,https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo/pull/219#issuecomment-1719988066,comments.body,"Do you have any ideas about our retention policy for backups?

I think S3 lets us tag our uploads, and then we can have different ""transitions"" dependent on the tag.

Probably something like this makes sense:
- We always keep the first backup of the month. (Transition it to Glacier Deep Archive after a year)
- We keep the first backup of the week for 6 months.
- We keep the first backup of the day for 30 days.
- We keep everything for 5 days.

More likely than not, if theres a massive data issue, we'll probably know about it within 5 days, or something has gone really wrong. Worst case though, we have the other backups policies to draw from :)

21,0,"Generally speaking, how would you order the precedence of config files, command line arguments and environment variables","ChatGPTIn many software systems, there are multiple ways to configure settings: configuration files, command line arguments, and environment variables. The precedence of these can vary depending on the specific software in question, but a common hierarchy might look like the following:Command Line Arguments: Typically take the highest precedence. If a setting is specified via a command line argument, it will override any settings provided via other methods. This is because command line arguments are often used for one-off runs and thus should offer the highest degree of specificity.Environment Variables: Often take the second-highest precedence. Environment variables are usually easier to change than config files, making them more dynamic. In a containerized or distributed environment (like Kubernetes), using environment variables for configuration is often easier and more flexible than using config files.Configuration Files: Usually have the lowest precedence among these three. Config files are often used for settings that are meant to be static and that apply system- or service-wide. Since these settings are generally not meant to change frequently, it makes sense for them to be easily overridden by more dynamic types of configuration.Default Values: Even lower than configuration files, these are the built-in settings that the software will use if no configuration is provided by any of the above methods.Here's a hypothetical example using a database connection:Default Value: localhost:5432Config File: Specifies the database should be at database.company.com:5432Environment Variable: Specifies the database should be at database.prod.company.com:5432Command Line Argument: Specifies the database should be at database.test.company.com:5432In this scenario, the software will attempt to connect to database.test.company.com:5432 because the command line argument takes precedence over all other methods of configuration.It is also worth noting that some software systems allow you to specify which method takes precedence over which, but the above order is generally common. Always check the documentation of the specific software in question for details on how it handles configuration precedence.",OPEN,https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/8902,https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/8902,body,"Fixes #8890 #8784

# Motivation

Almost every program that I can think of takes configuration parameters in this order of precedence:

1. Command line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration files

This ordering is based roughly on how dynamic/persistent each of these types of values are, which gives the user a lot of flexibility to override things in the way they see fit. It also feels like the most obvious and intuitive order. Chat GPT agrees with me that this is the standard and most intuitive way to do things:

https://chat.openai.com/share/68fb24c9-2b91-47bd-9fab-baa956702cca

There is some discussion here that seems to imply that maybe this is a deliberate behavior:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/242098#discussion_r1269891427

but this position doesn't make a ton of sense to me, given that, as I pointed out here:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/242098#discussion_r1314086627

users must opt in to impure behavior with the --impure flag for flake aware commands.



There is one open question in my mind, which is whether or not a NIX_PATH setting should actually clobber any settings from configuration files, or if the configuration file values should also be used.

As the code is currently written, the values in the configuration files will still take effect.

This is actually arguably inconsistent with what is written here:

https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/197afd08a1075d0bd34ba76d5b5f40b4b36966a2/doc/manual/src/command-ref/env-common.md#L22

The thing is, the current behavior is ALSO inconsistent with what is written there. If you set NIX_PATH="""" but have values in your nix.conf files, those paths will still be searched (as things stand atm).

```","ChatGPTIn Solidity, storage layout optimization can indeed save gas costs, but the specific example you provided doesn't necessarily result in significant gas savings just by rearranging the variables. This is because each storage slot in Ethereum costs the same amount of gas to write to or read from, regardless of the data type. Each storage slot is 32 bytes (or 256 bits), and Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) operates on 256-bit words.In your example:Contract A has uint128, uint256, and uint128 variables.Contract B has uint128, uint128, and uint256 variables.Both contracts will use the same number of storage slots:Contract A: 1 slot for x, 1 slot for y, and 1 slot for z = 3 slotsContract B: 1 slot for x, 1 slot for y, and 1 slot for z = 3 slotsHowever, if you were to pack smaller variables together into a single storage slot, you could save gas. Solidity allows you to do this manually by using structs. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, contract C uses only 2 storage slots: one for the PackedData struct (x and y are packed into a single 256-bit word) and one for z. This would be more gas-efficient when it comes to storage costs.So, while your original contracts A and B don't differ in terms of storage gas efficiency, you can use techniques like struct packing to optimize storage costs.",MERGED,https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/pull/191,https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/pull/191#discussion_r1340538359,reviews.body,"Update: it is not true that storage variables are tightly packed like struct fields.

(when-let (x (foo))

(when-let ((x (foo)))
  (bar x))","ChatGPTIn Emacs Lisp (Elisp), the when-let construct has had different acceptable forms in different Emacs versions. Historically, there have been two main variants of when-let: one from subr-x.el and the other from dash.el, a popular library that provides a lot of functional programming utilities.The one from subr-x.el typically uses a single pair of parentheses for binding, like so:[CODE_BLOCK_0]However, in Emacs 27+, a variant of when-let was introduced that allows multiple bindings without the extra pair of parentheses:[CODE_BLOCK_1]So both forms you provided are correct, depending on your Emacs version and your coding conventions. If you’re targeting Emacs 27 or later, you might prefer the latter form, but the former form with double parentheses will work across more Emacs versions and can be a little more explicit in signaling that it's a binding construct.",CLOSED,https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/3474,https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/3474,body,"I found out that cider-connect wasn't working for me on Emacs 29.

If you want to use await with the fs module, you can use the promises API introduced in Node.js version 10.0. Here's how you can do it:First, make sure you have the fs and util modules installed. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using npm or yarn:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Now, you can create an async function to read a JSON file using await. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this code, the readJsonFile function reads the JSON file asynchronously and returns the parsed JSON object.

37,0,"how to add a html, css and js base template","ChatGPTCreating a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) template involves setting up the fundamental structure for a webpage. Below are the steps to create a simple template:Create a Folder: Start by creating a new folder on your computer to organize your project files.HTML File (index.html):
Create an index.html file within the folder. This will serve as the main entry point for your webpage.[CODE_BLOCK_0]CSS File (styles.css):
Create a styles.css file in the same folder to style your webpage.[CODE_BLOCK_1]JavaScript File (script.js):
Create a script.js file to add interactivity to your webpage.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Folder Structure:
Your project folder should now look like this:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Open in Browser:
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see your template in action.Customize:
You can now customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in your template to build your desired webpage. Add more HTML elements, apply styling, and write JavaScript code to create interactive features.Remember, this is just a very basic template to get you started. As you develop your skills, you can explore more advanced techniques, frameworks, and libraries to create richer and more complex web applications.",MERGED,https://github.com/Sambath-Kumar-M/Portfolio/pull/1,https://github.com/Sambath-Kumar-M/Portfolio/pull/1,body,"![26Aug](https://github.com/Sambath-Kumar-M/Portfolio/assets/143013344/12df84ab-c3bb-474d-b6c7-31b5dbb3dd85)

42,0,"The following query in Postgres:
```
		DELETE FROM timeouts

		RETURNING peer, game, lobbies
		LIMIT 1
```
Returns
```
syntax error at or near ""LIMIT"" (SQLSTATE 42601)
``
How do I fix this?","ChatGPTThe DELETE statement in PostgreSQL does not support a LIMIT clause directly. The error you're seeing is due to the presence of the LIMIT 1 clause in your DELETE statement.To delete a limited number of rows, you can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the DELETE statement. Here's a way you can modify your query to delete a single row (similar to using LIMIT 1) based on your provided conditions:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This CTE selects the first row matching your condition, then deletes only that row from the timeouts table.Do note that this approach can be less performant than a straightforward DELETE when working with large tables, but for small operations, the difference is often negligible. If you frequently find yourself needing to delete a small number of rows based on complex criteria, this method should be suitable.",MERGED,https://github.com/poki/netlib/pull/50,https://github.com/poki/netlib/pull/50,body,"Use a slightly different query to work around this.

I quickly proof-read some parts and it looks okay, but of course there can be mistakes and I have not used the Skill before, so I don't know what some commands may stand for (e.g. I am confused how I can turn off my computer with Nextcloud via this skill now) We can always improve that later. I just thought this won't hurt as a start.
* As for the keyword Sabia I asked ChatGPT, but it was hardly helpful. I ended up just using ""Nextcloud"" for now, as it is propbably, what it is basically all about.

Hi @huozhi which config would you suggest to mark ""internal"" dependencies? Or is this usecase out of scope?
I agree that --external should be used for external dependencies and not internal code. I would hope this usecase could be supported with zero-config, but I'm not aware of multi-entry code-sharing features in Rollup.

I have a workaround like this: `bunchee --target es2022 --external ./index &&  sed -i '' \""s/'\\.\\/index'/'\\.\\/index\\.mjs'/g\"" bundle/server.mjs bundle/bin.mjs && sed -i '' \""s/'\\.\\/index'/'\\.\\/index\\.cjs'/g\"" bundle/server.cjs bundle/bin.cjs`

done < verbatim.csv >> section.csv","ChatGPTThis code snippet appears to be a Bash script that processes data from a CSV file (verbatim.csv) and extracts specific sections from a text file ($tex_file) based on the information provided in the CSV file. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does:IFS= read -r line; do: This part of the script reads lines from the verbatim.csv file and assigns each line to the variable line. The IFS= part sets the Internal Field Separator (IFS) to an empty value, which means that leading and trailing whitespace characters won't be trimmed from each line. The -r option for read prevents backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters.IFS=',' read -r ver_num start_point end_point ver_num_lines <<< ""$line"": This line splits the content of the line variable using a comma , as the delimiter. The data is then assigned to the variables ver_num, start_point, end_point, and ver_num_lines.section=$(find_section ""$start_point""): It seems like there is a function called find_section being called with the value of start_point as an argument. The purpose of this function is not provided in the code snippet, but based on the context, it's likely that it determines a section number or position in the $tex_file where the desired content should be extracted from.sed -n ""${section}p"" ""$tex_file"": This line uses the sed command to extract a specific line from the $tex_file based on the value of the section variable (likely the section number calculated earlier). The -n option suppresses automatic printing of lines. ""${section}p"" specifies that the line indicated by the value of section should be printed.done < verbatim.csv >> section.csv: The loop defined by the while statement processes each line in the verbatim.csv file. The output of the sed command (the extracted section) is then appended to the file section.csv.In summary, this script processes data from a CSV file containing version-related information and uses that information to extract specific sections from a text file. The extracted sections are then appended to another file named section.csv. The exact functionality of the script depends on the details of the find_section function and the structure of the CSV and text files involved.",MERGED,https://github.com/MikaelJG/textract/pull/1,https://github.com/MikaelJG/textract/pull/1#discussion_r1307791253,reviews.body,"```suggestion
# We must loop over each keyword in the comma-separated `keywords` value. According to Chat GPT, the way to do this is using IFS. However, since in this scope we are already using IFS to parse the string to split by `:` (e.g. `%keywords:var,vars:Variables`), we have to juggle the IFS.
# We save the old IFS, perform the loop over `keywords`, and then restore the original IFS.

54,0,"on github, how can i block merging a pr if tests fail?","ChatGPTOn GitHub, you can set up branch protection rules to prevent merging a pull request (PR) if tests fail. This is done by configuring required status checks for your repository. Status checks are automated tests or checks that need to pass before a pull request can be merged. Here's how you can do it:Create and Configure Required Status Checks:Navigate to your repository on GitHub.Click on ""Settings"" (usually located on the right side).In the left sidebar, click on ""Branches.""Under ""Branch protection rules,"" click on ""Add rule.""Choose the branch you want to protect (usually it's the main or master branch).Check the box next to ""Require status checks to pass before merging.""You'll see a list of status checks available for your repository. These could be related to continuous integration tools like Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, etc. These checks need to be set up beforehand in your repository's CI/CD configuration.Set Up CI/CD and Status Checks:Before you can enforce status checks, you need to have a continuous integration (CI) or continuous deployment (CD) process set up in your repository. This usually involves configuring a CI/CD tool to run tests and other checks whenever changes are pushed to the repository.For example, if you're using GitHub Actions, you would need to create a workflow configuration file (e.g., .github/workflows/main.yml) in your repository. This file defines the steps to run when a pull request is opened or when code is pushed to the repository. Within this workflow, you can define jobs that run tests, linters, and other checks.Here's a simple example using GitHub Actions:[CODE_BLOCK_0]You can replace the comment with actual commands to run your tests. Once you have your CI/CD set up, status checks will automatically appear in the ""Require status checks to pass before merging"" section of the branch protection settings.Save the Branch Protection Rule:After you've selected the required status checks, click ""Create"" or ""Save changes"" to create the branch protection rule.Now, whenever a pull request is opened, the configured status checks will automatically run. If any of these checks fail, GitHub will prevent the pull request from being merged until the checks pass. This helps maintain the quality and stability of your codebase by ensuring that changes are thoroughly tested before being merged.Keep in mind that the exact steps might vary depending on the CI/CD tool you're using and any updates made to GitHub's interface after my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021.",MERGED,https://github.com/MikaelJG/textract/pull/1,https://github.com/MikaelJG/textract/pull/1,body,"Demo 🎉 https://youtu.be/CCjoakvHAmY

      .SYNOPSIS
      This will install software using the chocolatey, with rate limiting when run with Hosts parameter
      .DESCRIPTION
      For installing packages using chocolatey. If you're running against more than 10, include the Hosts parameter to limit the speed. If running on more than 30 agents at a time make sure you also change the script timeout setting.
      .PARAMETER Mode
      3 options: install (default), uninstall, or upgrade.
      .PARAMETER Hosts
      Use this to specify the number of computer(s) you're running the command on. This will dynamically introduce waits to try and minimize the chance of hitting rate limits (20/min) on the chocolatey.org site: Hosts 20
      .PARAMETER PackageName
      Use this to specify which software('s) to install eg: PackageName googlechrome. You can use multiple value with semicolon separated. 
      .EXAMPLE
      -Hosts 20 -PackageName googlechrome
      -Hosts 30 -PackageName googlechrome,vlc

The script also includes logic to introduce a delay when running against multiple hosts to avoid hitting rate limits on the Chocolatey website.Here's a brief review of the script:Synopsis, Description, Parameters, Examples, and Notes: These sections provide documentation for the script, explaining its purpose, how to use it, and its history.Parameters:Hosts: The number of computers you're running the command on.PackageName: The software package(s) you want to install, uninstall, or upgrade.Mode: The operation mode (install, uninstall, or upgrade).Logic:If the mode is not ""upgrade"" and no package name is provided, the script exits with an error message.If the Hosts parameter is provided, a random delay is calculated based on the number of hosts. This is to avoid hitting rate limits.Depending on the Mode, the script will either upgrade, install, or uninstall the specified package(s).Potential Improvements and Observations:The script assumes that if the mode is ""upgrade"" and no package name is provided, all packages should be upgraded (choco upgrade -y all). This is a potentially dangerous operation, so you might want to include a warning or confirmation prompt.The script uses Start-Sleep to introduce a delay based on the number of hosts. This is a simple way to avoid rate limits, but it might not be the most efficient approach, especially if you're running the script on a large number of hosts.The script uses Exit 0 to indicate successful completion and Exit 1 to indicate an error. This is a common convention in scripting, but you might want to include more detailed error handling and logging, especially if you're using this script in a production environment.The script includes some commented-out Write-Output lines. These are likely for debugging purposes. You might want to remove them or replace them with proper logging.Overall, the script looks functional for its intended purpose.

will i be able to use this as an api for my website","ChatGPTThe code you've provided is a Python script that generates QR codes, creates tickets by adding QR codes to a custom ticket design, and sends emails with the tickets attached. It seems like you want to use this code as an API for your website. However, there are some considerations and modifications you need to make to achieve that:Web Framework: The code uses Flask for sending emails, but it's not designed to serve as a web API for generating QR codes and tickets. You need to modify it to set up a Flask web application properly.API Endpoints: Define Flask routes that handle specific API endpoints for generating QR codes and tickets.Request Handling: You'll need to modify the code to accept input from HTTP requests, process the requests, and send back responses. Flask provides mechanisms for handling incoming requests and sending responses.Security: When setting up a web API, it's crucial to implement proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.API Documentation: You should document your API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats for users who will be consuming your API.Deployment: Deploy your Flask application on a web server that's accessible from the internet, such as AWS, Heroku, or a VPS.Scalability: Consider the potential scalability of your API. Will it handle multiple requests concurrently? You may need to optimize your code or use tools like Gunicorn for this.Error Handling: Implement error handling and return meaningful error responses for different scenarios.Testing: Test your API thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.Access Control: If this API is meant for public use, consider access control mechanisms and authentication to protect your resources.Overall, while the code you provided can serve as a foundation for building a QR code generation and ticketing API, it requires significant modifications and additional components to make it suitable for use in a production environment. Additionally, the specific modifications needed will depend on your website's requirements and the desired functionality of your API.",CLOSED,https://github.com/TechnoTOG/GetEntry/pull/4,https://github.com/TechnoTOG/GetEntry/pull/4#issuecomment-1712463286,comments.body,"> possible issue with calling flask app

Here's how it generally worked:Push from GitHub to Transifex: When you updated source files (like .po or .json files) in your GitHub repository, those changes could be automatically reflected in your Transifex project. This meant that new strings or updated strings in your source files would be available for translation in Transifex.Pull from Transifex to GitHub: Translated files from Transifex could be pulled into your GitHub repository, either manually or on a schedule. This allowed you to keep your repository updated with the latest translations from Transifex.So, yes, the integration was bidirectional – changes in the GitHub repo could be reflected in Transifex, and translations in Transifex could be reflected back in the GitHub repo.

I asked gpt both to install docsify-cli and also to edit package.json by heredocing the full file, in the same script. So it guessed the version in order to not loose the newly installed dep.


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

>>> a = ""GH_GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGA""
>>> b = a.lstrip(""GH_"")

'A'","ChatGPTThe behavior you're observing is because the lstrip method in Python does not work the way you might expect in this context.When you call a.lstrip(""GH_""), it does not remove the substring ""GH_"" from the beginning of the string a. Instead, it removes any characters that are in the set ""GH_"" from the left side (beginning) of the string until it encounters a character that is not in that set.In your case, the string ""GH_"" contains the characters 'G' and 'H', and it's treating both 'G' and 'H' as characters to be removed from the left side of the string. So, it starts removing 'G' characters from the left until it encounters 'A', which is not in the ""GH_"" set. Therefore, it stops at 'A', and that's why you get 'A' as the result.If you want to specifically remove the substring ""GH_"" from the beginning of the string, you can use slicing like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will correctly remove ""GH_"" from the beginning of the string, and you will get the desired result:[CODE_BLOCK_1]",MERGED,https://github.com/alteryx/locust-grasshopper/pull/25,https://github.com/alteryx/locust-grasshopper/pull/25#discussion_r1331839245,reviews.body,"```

In the normal auth flow with Uppy:
- User clicks auth
- Browser Tab1 (Uppy) pops up another browser Tab2 (Auth flow)
- Tab2 runs the auth flow with the provider
- Tab2 auth flow redirects to companion's callback endpoint, which returns HTML that calls `window.opener.postMessage(token)` to send the token back to Tab1
- Tab2 calls `window.close()` to close Tab2
- Tab1 finishes the auth with the received auth token

However in the case of Instagram, it's a bit different:
- Browser Tab1 opens Tab2 with Instagram auth flow
- Tab2 opens Instagram app
- Instagram app runs auth flow and returns to Tab2
- Tab2 auth flow redirects to companion's callback endpoint, which returns HTML that calls `window.opener.postMessage(token)` to send the token back to Tab1
- However Tab2 `window.opener` is now `null` and it crashes, and there is no way for Tab2 to message the token back to Tab1.","ChatGPTThe situation you're describing arises due to the behavior of mobile browsers with respect to window.opener. When the Instagram app opens and takes focus away from the browser, it's possible that upon returning, the mobile browser views the original Tab1 as having been closed or lost context, thus window.opener is null. Here are some potential solutions:Server-side Handling:Instead of relying on the client-side (Tab2) to send the token back to Tab1 directly, consider a server-side flow.After the authentication is successful, store the token temporarily on the server side, linked to a unique identifier (could be a short-lived session or a random token).Provide the user with a visual confirmation on Tab2 that authentication was successful and instruct them to return to Tab1.Once the user is back on Tab1, retrieve the token from the server using the aforementioned unique identifier.Local Storage:After authentication, you can store the token temporarily in local storage or session storage on Tab2.When the user returns to Tab1, have it poll or check the local/session storage for the token.This is not a super robust solution, but it does bypass the window.opener problem.Use a Custom URL Scheme:If you have control over the app, you might consider implementing a custom URL scheme.After Instagram app authentication, instead of redirecting to Tab2, redirect to a custom URL scheme that the original web app can handle.This would allow you to pass data directly from the Instagram app back to the original app.Push Notifications:If the user has push notifications enabled, you could notify them of successful authentication.You might still need a mechanism like server-side handling to securely get the token back to Tab1, but this provides a better user experience.QR Code:On successful authentication, display a QR code containing the token or a reference to the token.User can scan the QR code on Tab1 to retrieve the token.Fallback to Manual Input:As a last resort, if you cannot pass the token automatically, you could display the token (or a shorter representation of it) to the user and ask them to manually input it on Tab1.Finally, I'd recommend reporting this as a bug or limitation to the Uppy and/or Instagram teams. They may already be working on a solution, or your feedback might prompt them to explore the issue further.",OPEN,https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4110,https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4110#issuecomment-1709589496,comments.body,"here are GPT's thoughts on handling the Instagram auth token problem:

## What happens when the Bench Master is not available?

It's important to have a backup Bench Master in case the Bench Master is not available. 

- The backup Bench Master should be someone who is familiar with the internal projects and the skills of the developers. 
- A semi-regular catchup between the Bench Master and the backup Bench Master would be a good idea to ensure that the backup Bench Master is up to date with the current state of the bench.
- Always CC a distribution list that has the Bench Master and backup Bench Master on any emails regarding the bench.
- If the Bench Master knows they will be unavailable for a period of time they should ask the backup Bench Master to monitor the distribution list for any emails regarding the bench.

","ChatGPTIn Python, both __dict__ and to_dict are related to managing and converting objects, but they are not directly comparable as they serve different purposes.__dict__:
__dict__ is a special attribute in Python that holds a dictionary containing the instance's attributes and their values.

This allows you to access and manipulate object attributes dynamically.For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]to_dict:
to_dict is not a built-in feature of Python itself, but rather a common naming convention used in libraries or custom classes to provide a method that converts an object's attributes into a dictionary.

85,0,What is the difference between SpotifyClientCredentials vs SpotifyOAuth,"ChatGPTIn the context of the Spotify API, SpotifyClientCredentials and SpotifyOAuth are two different authorization flows used to authenticate and authorize access to Spotify's resources.SpotifyClientCredentials:
SpotifyClientCredentials is a simple and straightforward authorization flow suitable for server-to-server authentication. It relies on client credentials, which consist of a client ID and a client secret. With this flow, you authenticate your application as a whole rather than authenticating individual users. The client ID and secret are obtained by registering your application with the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Once authenticated, your application can access public resources on Spotify, such as retrieving playlists or albums.However, with SpotifyClientCredentials, you don't have access to user-specific resources or actions, like modifying playlists or accessing a user's playback state. This flow is primarily used for applications that don't require individual user permissions and operate on public data.SpotifyOAuth:
SpotifyOAuth is an authorization flow that allows individual users to grant your application permission to access their Spotify account and perform actions on their behalf. It's commonly used for applications that require user-specific functionalities, such as creating playlists, modifying a user's library, or accessing a user's playback information.The SpotifyOAuth flow involves a user authentication step where the user is redirected to the Spotify Accounts service to grant your application permission. Once the user grants access, your application receives an access token that can be used to make authorized API requests on behalf of the user. This access token is typically short-lived and needs to be refreshed periodically using a refresh token.The SpotifyOAuth flow provides a more comprehensive and flexible authorization mechanism as it allows your application to interact with user-specific resources and actions.In summary, SpotifyClientCredentials is used for server-to-server authentication, granting access to public resources, while SpotifyOAuth is used for user-specific authentication, enabling access to user-specific resources and actions. The choice between the two depends on the requirements of your application and the level of access you need to Spotify's resources.",MERGED,https://github.com/IararIV/karaok.ai/pull/1,https://github.com/IararIV/karaok.ai/pull/1,body,"already gets top k matches for tracks

When you make changes to your Gemfile or just want to update the gems to their latest versions, you'll need to update the Gemfile.lock accordingly.Here are the steps to update Gemfile.lock:Update All Gems to Their Latest Versions:
If you want to update all the gems listed in your Gemfile to their latest versions, you can use:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will fetch the latest versions of all gems and their dependencies, and it will also update the Gemfile.lock file.Update a Specific Gem:
If you only want to update a particular gem, use:[CODE_BLOCK_1]For example, to update fastlane:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Using Specific Versions:
If you wish to use a specific version of a gem or a specific range of versions, you can specify that in the Gemfile. For instance:[CODE_BLOCK_3]This will ensure that when you run bundle update fastlane, only the versions 2.180.x will be considered. After making changes to the Gemfile, you'll need to run bundle install or bundle update to update the Gemfile.lock file.Checking for Outdated Gems:
Before updating, you might want to see which gems have newer versions available. You can use:[CODE_BLOCK_4]This command will display a list of gems that have newer versions available than what's specified in the Gemfile.lock.Committing the Changes:
After updating the gems and Gemfile.lock, ensure that you commit the changes to your version control system (e.g., git) to maintain consistency across your team and environments.Good Practice:
It's a good practice to frequently check for updates and apply them to keep your tools and libraries up-to-date. However, always test your project after updating gems to ensure compatibility and to catch any potential issues introduced by the updated gems.Remember, whenever you make a change to the Gemfile, whether adding a new gem or changing a version, you should run bundle install to ensure that the Gemfile.lock is synchronized and up-to-date.",MERGED,https://github.com/SharezoneApp/sharezone-app/pull/880,https://github.com/SharezoneApp/sharezone-app/pull/880#issuecomment-1705553269,comments.body,"> LGTM.

92,0,image inside container moves around when zoomed in tailwind,"ChatGPTIf you're experiencing an issue with an image inside a container moving around when zoomed in using Tailwind CSS, it might be due to the way you have applied styles or container properties. To help you fix the problem, here are some steps you can take:Make sure the container has a fixed width and height: Ensure that the container holding the image has a fixed width and height. This will prevent it from resizing and moving the image around when zooming in.Use Tailwind CSS classes for responsive behavior: Tailwind CSS provides responsive utility classes like w-auto, h-auto, object-cover, object-contain, etc., which can help you control the image behavior on different screen sizes.Avoid using absolute positioning: Avoid using absolute positioning for the image within the container. This can cause the image to break out of its container and behave unexpectedly when zooming in.Here's an example of how you can structure your HTML and Tailwind CSS classes to keep the image inside the container without moving around when zoomed in:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the container (div) has a fixed width (w-64) and height (h-64). The image inside the container uses the object-cover class, which scales the image proportionally and crops it to cover the entire container.

## Introduction

Users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assume
that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and
intellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. This
trust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for the
sustainability of the website’s business.

Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:
- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want or
need to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertisers
can only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for human
users to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.
- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors often
want to promote posts with fake engagement (for example, to promote products, or make a news story
seem more important). Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people if
websites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.
- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software that
enforces the game's rules.
- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like their
banking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users if
it could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthy
software.

The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collection
and interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are considered
essential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used to
track users across sites without their knowledge or control.

We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could help
address these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.

## Web environment integrity

With the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests key
facts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that a
user is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will be
prevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.

Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. 
It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system (platform) as a
matter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multiple
operating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration from
existing native attestation signals such as
[App Attest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server)
and the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity). 

There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts and
high coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or
non-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge the
significant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically available
(e.g. holdouts). 

## Goals

- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of the
software stack and the traffic from the device.
- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.
- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.
- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.

## Non-goals

- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, as
client javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. 
- Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.
- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/).

## Example use cases

- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.
- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content
- Detect phishing campaigns (e.g. webviews in malicious apps) 
- Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.
- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients
- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk
- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing

## How it works

There are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:

- The web page executing in a user's web browser
- A third party that can “attest” to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as the
attester
- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on this
information.

1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a ""content binding"". The
content binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it to
attest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the web
page is running on.
1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding (referred to
as the payload) with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the web
page. The attester’s public key is available to everyone to request.
1. The webpage returns this information to the web server.  The web server then checks that the
token came from an attester it trusts and inspects the token’s payload. It verifies the payload by
verifying the signature with the attester’s public key.
1. Optionally, the web server may call the attester’s server endpoint to get additional
(low-entropy) signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.

    Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc
    website->>browser:response
```

### What information is in the signed attestation?

The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:
- The attester's identity, for example, ""Google Play"".
- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.

We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included and
welcome your feedback:
-  The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should we
allow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases without
locking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.
- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,
org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.
- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical device

We strongly feel the following data should never be included:
- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers

## How can I use web environment integrity?

There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to request
an environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.

```js
// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a “content binding” of the request you are
// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being
// used for a different request.
// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed
// before it is sent to the attester.
const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` +
    ""Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding..."";

const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegrity(contentBinding);

console.log(attestation.encode());
""<base-64 encoding of the attestation payload and signature approx 500 bytes; see below for details>""

// More on attestation validation below
const response = await fetch(`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode()}`);
// Do something with this ...
```

The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR (RFC 8949) and signed
using COSE (RFC 9052). Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be found
in the specification.

The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information is
valid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on the
information reported.

```js
// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being

## Challenges and threats to address

### Quality of attesters

Web Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions the
attesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements for
attesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attester’s utility on its own merit. Users should
also be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal quality
expectations.

### Tracking users’ browser history

User agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We are
researching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, while
allowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debugging—with transparency
reporting and auditability.

### Fingerprinting

This explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannot
be tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information that
can identify users/devices.

All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. For
example, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numeric
value. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrity
as attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.

How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?
- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attesting
to, with readable and verifiable verdicts.
- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.
We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from one
role to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation response
meets the entropy requirements. 

### Cross-site tracking

While attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestation
tokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,
two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains any
unique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.

The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains can
conspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkability
between relying parties (websites requesting attestation) and the attester in a way that prevents
scaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging of
broken attestations.

The partitioning will be different for different profiles (e.g. Incognito profiles get different
partitions even if it’s the same site the user visited on their regular profile). The user should
also be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within the
same partition.

The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidence
levels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.

## Detailed design discussion

### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?

When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead it
adds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encoding
to JSON.

[Web Authn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makes
sense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.

### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?

Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, it
does not restrict the indicated application’s functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,
the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request Web
Environment Integrity attestation.

## Considered alternatives

### Make this an extension of the fetch API

Once a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it should
have more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetch
allows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without adding
overhead to the rest.

Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive will
enable us to build on it at a later stage.

### Privacy Pass / Private Access Tokens
Apple and Cloudflare have developed
[Private Access Tokens](https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/)
for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass (Private State
Tokens). However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester can
produce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps such
as false positives or false negatives.

We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarial
pressure and the defender’s ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abuse
tactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positives
and false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.

## Open questions

### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?

Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to only
support attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser is
running, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these go
against the principles we aspire to for the open web.

Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who
wishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on the
given OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1) some
websites might exclude some operating systems, and 2) if the platform identity of the
application that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.

#### Holdback

To protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be held
back for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time (in other words, on a
small percentage of (client, site) pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support this
capability). Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregate
analysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback would
effectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, because
otherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.

Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcement
decisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. 

However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, we
have identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.
These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropy
attestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usher
in more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.

We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested in
alternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.

#### Attester-level acceptable browser policy

If the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of the
application, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certain
OS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,
and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trust
(based on a well-defined acceptance criteria). As new browsers are introduced, they would need to
demonstrate to attesters (a relatively small group) that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't need
to convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attesters
that respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.

## How are WebViews different?

WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose more
information than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to those
APIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. In
particular:

- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.
- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditions
(for example, opt-in).

Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduced adaptive icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. However, if an app doesn't provide an adaptive icon, or if the device is running an Android version that doesn't support them, it might add a white background to make the icon match other icons.To make sure your icon appears consistently across all devices, you can use Android Studio's Image Asset Studio to create adaptive icons. It allows you to create different foreground and background layers for your icon, which the system then uses to create an adaptive icon.Here's a brief guide:Right-click the res folder and select New > Image Asset.On the ""Asset Type"" dropdown, select Adaptive and Legacy.Click on the Foreground Layer or Background Layer tabs to upload or design your icon.Preview how your icon looks with different shapes and in different sizes, and adjust your design if necessary.Click Next > Finish.Remember, the key to a good adaptive icon is simplicity.

Do you have any idea why I am getting this error?","ChatGPTThe error message ""Cannot find module 'libp2p'"" means that Jest, the test runner, is unable to find the 'libp2p' module when running your tests.This could happen for several reasons:The 'libp2p' module is not installed: You can check if 'libp2p' module is in your 'node_modules' directory, and if it's not there, you need to install it with npm install libp2p or yarn add libp2p command.The module is not correctly imported: Make sure that the import statement in your file matches the exact name and location of the 'libp2p' module. If the module is located in a different directory, you may need to adjust the path accordingly.Jest configuration issues: If 'libp2p' is a native module (which it is), or it uses native code under the hood, you may need to adjust your Jest configuration to mock these native dependencies. Jest runs in a Node environment, and it does not have access to native modules, hence they need to be mocked.You can create a manual mock for 'libp2p' module by following these steps:In your __mocks__ directory, create a file called 'libp2p.ts'.In this file, export a mocked version of the 'libp2p' module. This might look something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then in your test file, you can tell Jest to use the mocked version of 'libp2p' like so:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Remember, the actual implementation of the mock depends on how 'libp2p' is used in your code.The error may also arise if the module is installed globally but not locally in your project. Jest may not be able to pick up globally installed modules. In this case, installing the module locally should resolve the issue.You are using a version of 'libp2p' that is not compatible with your version of Node.js or Jest. Try installing a different version of the 'libp2p' module.There is an issue with your Node.js or npm/yarn setup.

101,0,Are there any risks / trade-offs involved with setting SO_REUSEADDR on outgoing TCP connection sockets underlying an HTTP client? I've used that socket option for incoming connections but never for outgoing.,"ChatGPTThe SO_REUSEADDR socket option can be used to avoid the ""address already in use"" error that can occur when a program attempts to bind a socket to an address/port that's already in use.For incoming connections (i.e., servers), this socket option allows a new server to be started on the same address/port as an old one is in the TIME_WAIT state, which is useful for servers that are stopped and then immediately restarted.For outgoing connections (i.e., clients), the usefulness of SO_REUSEADDR is less clear, and its use can potentially introduce some risks/trade-offs:Port Collisions: If you are binding your client socket to a specific port (which is unusual for client sockets; usually you let the system choose an ephemeral port), and you have SO_REUSEADDR set, you may run into a situation where another process also binds to that port and starts receiving your data. This is because SO_REUSEADDR allows multiple sockets to be bound to the same address/port pair, as long as only one of them is actively listening.Misdirected Data: Again, if you are binding your client socket to a specific port and you have SO_REUSEADDR set, there's a risk that if your client closes and then quickly reopens while the server still has data to send, that data might be received by the new socket connection. This is because the server may still be in the TIME_WAIT state and believe the old connection is valid.It's also worth noting that the exact behavior of SO_REUSEADDR can vary between different operating systems, so testing any assumptions about its behavior is important if you're writing software that needs to run on multiple platforms.Most of the time for client-side sockets, you don't even need to bind to a specific port. You can just create a socket and then connect to the remote server, and the operating system will pick an unused ephemeral port for the outgoing connection. This makes SO_REUSEADDR largely unnecessary for client-side sockets.So, in general, while there can be specific cases where SO_REUSEADDR might be useful on the client side, these cases are relatively rare, and the potential risks often outweigh the benefits.",OPEN,https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/pull/638,https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/pull/638#issuecomment-1650244437,comments.body,Here's what GPT4 had to say about this: https://chat.openai.com/share/b515e3dc-6193-4550-8d5d-3ecaa8088755,tsenart/vegeta,638,1,3,True,Neutral

108,0,"In older Fortran codes, one often uses the following syntax when passing an array into a subroutine ""f"" that expects an array:

call f(A(10))

And the meaning of this syntax is that it passes an array section A(10:), that is, it is a pointer to element number 10, and inside the subroutine ""f"", it behaves like an array.","ChatGPTYes, you are correct. In older Fortran codes, particularly in versions prior to Fortran 90, this syntax was commonly used to pass array sections to subroutines.When you use call f(A(10)), you are passing a section of the array A starting from element 10 onwards. This means that inside the subroutine f, the array will start from element 10, but the subroutine itself is unaware of the original size of the array A.It's important to note that this approach had some limitations and could lead to potential issues if not used carefully. For example, if the subroutine f assumes that the array passed to it always starts from element 1, it may not behave as expected.With the introduction of Fortran 90 and later versions, array syntax and handling was significantly improved with the inclusion of explicit array dimensions and dynamic memory allocation, making it easier and more intuitive to work with arrays in Fortran.

What is the difference between the different measurements for hello_world? Why does Function/routes.app:hello_world, WebTransaction/Function/routes.app:hello_world and WebTransactionTotalTime/Function/routes.app:hello_world report different durations?


","ChatGPTThe different measurements for hello_world in the NRQL query results indicate different aspects of the performance metrics captured by New Relic. Let's break down each one:Function/routes.app:hello_worldThis measurement represents the execution time of the specific function named hello_world within your application.In your provided results, it has an average duration of approximately 0.137 milliseconds.This focuses on the processing time of the code in that particular function and how long it takes to execute.WebTransaction/Function/routes.app:hello_worldThis measurement represents the total time taken for a web transaction that involves the hello_world function.In your provided results, it has an average duration of approximately 1.192 milliseconds.It encompasses the time taken by the function itself (Function/routes.app:hello_world), plus any additional overhead or processing associated with the web transaction (e.g., middleware, networking).WebTransactionTotalTime/Function/routes.app:hello_worldThis measurement is similar to WebTransaction/Function/routes.app:hello_world, but it might include even more elements. It represents the total time taken for a web transaction involving the hello_world function, including additional processing time.In your provided results, it also has an average duration of approximately 1.192 milliseconds.In this particular case, it seems like WebTransaction and WebTransactionTotalTime are reporting the same values, but in other cases, there might be differences based on more extensive processing, parallel executions, or background tasks linked to the transaction.Apdex/Function/routes.app:hello_worldThis measurement generally indicates the Apdex score, which is a measure of user satisfaction based on the response time of web applications and services. However, in this case, it seems to be showing the count without a score. Apdex is useful for gauging whether the performance is within acceptable levels for user experience.Function/routes.app:hello_world.<locals>.<lambda>This measurement represents the execution time of a lambda function which is locally defined within the hello_world function.It has a very small duration (approximately 0.023 milliseconds) as it's probably executing a very specific and limited piece of logic.In summary, Function/routes.app:hello_world represents the time taken by the function itself, WebTransaction/Function/routes.app:hello_world represents the total time taken by the web transaction involving this function, and WebTransactionTotalTime/Function/routes.app:hello_world potentially includes even more elements associated with the transaction.",MERGED,https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/pull/1638,https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/pull/1638#discussion_r1275340806,reviews.body,"Based on all the data I saw, we should get the numbers from Function/* rather than WebTransaction/Function/*.

```","ChatGPTrelease.sh Bash Script DocumentationThe release.sh script is a Bash script that automates the release process for a project using the lerna package manager. It performs the following actions:Retrieves the release type from the first command-line argument ($RELEASE_TYPE) and optionally the target version from the second argument ($TARGET_VERSION).Determines if an alpha release is required based on the release type.Sets the new version for the project using lerna version command, either by generating it automatically or using the target version.Ensures that all packages are up-to-date by running pnpm install, pnpm package, and pnpm build.Creates a release commit with a signed message containing the new version.Publishes the new version to npm, either as a regular release or an alpha release.Waits for the changes to be available on npm for a brief period.Upgrades packages in the project's examples to the new version.Creates a tag for the new version and pushes the changes to the remote repository.Usage:Make sure the script has executable permissions (chmod +x release.sh).Run the script with the necessary command-line arguments:[CODE_BLOCK_0]<RELEASE_TYPE>: The type of release to perform (e.g., major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor, prepatch, or prerelease).[TARGET_VERSION] (optional): The target version to set explicitly. If not provided, lerna will generate the version automatically.Examples:[CODE_BLOCK_1][CODE_BLOCK_2]Note:The script assumes that lerna.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, and package.json files are present in the project directory.It is recommended to use a secure execution environment (e.g., CI/CD) for running this script to ensure proper signing and authentication mechanisms.",MERGED,https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678,https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678,body,Generated with in part thanks to https://chat.openai.com/share/7538b618-c08d-45b7-a4ed-bb168e9c1eb0,swarmion/swarmion,678,1,2,True,Positive
116,0,"What format is usually used for field names in a TOML file? snake_case, camelCase or kebab-case?","ChatGPTIn TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language), field names are typically written in snake_case. Snake_case is the convention where words are separated by underscores, and it is commonly used for field names, keys, and identifiers in TOML files. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]While TOML is often written in snake_case, it is worth noting that TOML is designed to be human-readable and is relatively flexible in terms of field names. Some parsers may accept other formats like camelCase or kebab-case, but snake_case is the most widely used convention in the TOML community and is recommended for consistency and clarity.",MERGED,https://github.com/ldez/tagliatelle/pull/22,https://github.com/ldez/tagliatelle/pull/22#issuecomment-1744850167,comments.body,"> When you say that you have to prove it. With this kind of argument, you can say what you want.

I'm sorry, I wasn't talking about an open source project, that's why I couldn't attach some links.

> but your PR changes the default values in the code.

This is true. Initially, it was only about documentation, but then I discovered that you did not add this tag at all.
Although it's popular a lot in Go enterprise projects.

> but there is no real convention around TOML naming.

I expected such answer and, of course, did extra analysis before PR 👌 

For some of your other defaults there is no convention too.

E.g. 

1) JSON – no convention. But typically for Python/PHP it's `snake_case`, for Java/JS it's `camelCase`. Usually people reference to [Google JSON Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format).

2) YAML – no convention. The most popular option is `snake_case` (dictated by Python), but you selected `camelCase` like in k8s (?)

3) Header – case-insensitive by RFC. And I remember recommendation to use `foo-bar` instead of `Foo-Bar` (to support different libraries in different languages).

etc.

---

I selected `snake_case` for TOML based on my experience.

Asked ChatGPT for interest 😄 
https://chat.openai.com/share/8b245bcd-837f-47f6-a5fa-b3c7b47d9aad

--- 

I see the next options:
1) You close PR, if disagree.
2) You merge PR as is, if agree with points above.
3) I switch default format for TOML to anything what you want, and merge it.
4) I remove the default rule, but add `toml` to the example in the README (so people can grep it), and merge it.

","ChatGPTThe code you provided appears to be a part of a Minecraft mod called ""NotEnoughUpdates."" This mod seems to add various features and enhancements to the game. Let me explain the main components and functionality of this code:Copyright and License Information: The code begins with copyright and license information, indicating that it is open-source software distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).Package and Imports: The code is part of the io.github.moulberry.notenoughupdates.miscfeatures package and includes several import statements to use classes and methods from Minecraft and other libraries.Item Cooldowns: This class, named ItemCooldowns, appears to manage cooldowns for specific items and their abilities within the game.Patterns: The code defines several regular expressions (regex patterns) to match specific chat messages that indicate the activation of certain item abilities.Static Variables: The class contains various static variables, including cooldown timers for different items, maps to store durability overrides for items, and other related information.Event Handling: The code utilizes the Forge modding framework to handle various events in Minecraft, such as tick events, world loading events, and chat message events.Block Data Storage: There is a nested class called BlockData that is used to store information about blocks, particularly the state of a block at a specific position and time.Enum Item: An enumeration called Item is defined to represent different item types, such as pickaxes, Bonzo's Mask, and Spirit Mask.Tick Event Handling: The tick method is used to manage cooldowns and timers, update block data, and reset some values periodically.World Load Event Handling: The onWorldLoad method clears and resets some data when the game world is loaded.Block Click Handling: The blockClicked method is used to store information about blocks that have been clicked or interacted with by the player.Block Change Packet Processing: The processBlockChangePacket method processes block change packets, particularly when blocks are mined.Chat Message Handling: The onChatMessage method listens for specific chat messages related to item abilities and updates cooldowns accordingly.Durability Override: The getDurabilityOverride method calculates and returns the durability override for certain items based on cooldowns and item-specific configurations.Overall, this code is responsible for tracking cooldowns and handling various game events related to item abilities in Minecraft when the ""NotEnoughUpdates"" mod is active. It also provides functionality to display durability overrides for specific items with cooldowns.",CLOSED,https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates/pull/849,https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates/pull/849#issuecomment-1743432230,comments.body,"@romangraef 

I have not thought about any underlying problems that still exist. I have not really thought much about the problem at all tbh.
I just thought this is an simple enough solution to let AI fix it: https://chat.openai.com/share/48fbc5e3-db1f-4879-8f9c-1b473e0d4877

I have tested the result and can confirm it fixes the currently existing bug.

I have disclosed the information that this change is done with the help of AI here already: https://discord.com/channels/516977525906341928/755816367827058749/1158411534192615575


I could have fixed it myself without ai as well. But I felt like trying the chat GPT solution and it was good enough for me soo I don't cared anymore.

I'm happy to hear your more technical explanation in what way the approach of this pr fixes the bug but still has other, deeper problems.

```","ChatGPTThe provided code is a function combine written in a language that appears to be inspired by F# or another ML-like language with some verbose naming conventions, possibly specific to a platform called Darklang. The function takes a list of results and combines them into a single result.Here's a breakdown of the function's behavior and performance:Purpose:
The function aims to combine a list of results (Ok or Error) into a single result. If all the results are Ok, it returns a single Ok with a list of all the Ok values. If there's at least one Error in the list, it returns the first Error it encounters.Performance:Time Complexity:
The function uses a fold operation on the list of results, which has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.However, the function also makes use of pushBack inside the fold. If pushBack is an O(1) operation (constant time, as in appending to a dynamic array), then the overall time complexity remains O(n). If pushBack is an O(m) operation where m is the current size of the list (as in appending to a linked list), the overall time complexity would be O(n^2).Space Complexity:
If the fold operation is implemented tail-recursively and if we assume that pushBack doesn't consume additional space proportionally to the size of the list (or if it does so in a way that's garbage collected efficiently), the space complexity is O(n) because of the accumulated list of 'Ok' values.Improvement Considerations:If pushBack is an O(n) operation, it may be more efficient to build the list in reverse using an operation like cons or pushFront which typically takes constant time for linked lists, and then reverse the list at the end.If the platform supports early exit from fold-like operations (like Haskell's foldl' with lazy evaluation), you could potentially break out of the fold as soon as you encounter the first Error, avoiding unnecessary iterations.In summary, the exact performance of this code will depend on the underlying implementations of the functions it uses, especially pushBack. If you know the specific behaviors of these functions, you can make a more accurate estimation of the overall performance.",MERGED,https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5068,https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/5068#discussion_r1321927695,reviews.body,"I think appending it to the front and then reversing should do it.

124,0,"When defining interfaces in typescript, is it common to use an `I` prefix for interface names?","ChatGPTIn the TypeScript community, there has been some debate over whether to use an I prefix for interface names. Historically, the practice of prefixing interfaces with an I comes from languages like C#.In the early days of TypeScript, some developers adopted this convention, but over time the community has largely moved away from it. Here are some reasons:Redundancy: In TypeScript, interfaces are the primary way to define type shapes. Given their ubiquity, some argue that the I prefix is redundant.The TypeScript Handbook: The official TypeScript documentation and handbook do not use the I prefix for interfaces. This sets a precedent for the community.Refactoring: If you decide to change an interface to a class or vice versa, the name would either become misleading or would need to change, leading to more extensive refactoring.Readability: Some developers feel that the I prefix can clutter code and reduce readability.However, there are still some reasons teams might choose to use the I prefix:Clarity: It can make it immediately clear that a type is an interface.Avoiding Naming Collisions: If you have an interface and a class that would naturally have the same name, the I prefix can help differentiate them.If you're deciding whether to use the I prefix in your TypeScript project:Consistency is Key: Whichever convention you choose, apply it consistently throughout your codebase.Team Decision: Discuss with your team and decide on a convention that everyone agrees on.Consider the Project's History: If you're working on an existing project, it might be best to follow the existing convention, unless there's a strong reason to refactor.In summary, while the I prefix was more common in the early days of TypeScript, the broader community has largely moved away from it.

### How we incorporated HCD

The [MERL Center definition of HCD](https://merlcenter.org/human-centered-design-definition.html) is as follows:
> “Human-centered design (HCD) is a framework that places the needs, desires and behaviors of key stakeholders, beneficiaries, users or teaching staff at the center of design and implementation decisions. HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.”

In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.
```","ChatGPTThe issue you're encountering is likely due to the way markdown handles blockquotes and following text. Generally, markdown does not automatically add extra space between a blockquote and the following text.The simplest solution would be to add an extra line between the blockquote and the paragraph that starts with ""In an attempt"". This should create a space similar to that between regular paragraphs. Here is how it should look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]I added a backslash (\) on an empty line to force a line break after the blockquote.

So I can't see why it doesn't see the result as matching `T_Xarray`.","ChatGPTThe issue you're encountering is related to the way that Python's type checking and generics work. The error message you're seeing is due to the type checker not being able to guarantee that the type returned by obj.reindex is the same as T_Xarray.Here's a breakdown of the situation:T_Xarray is a generic type that can be either DataArray or Dataset.Even though both DataArray and Dataset have a .reindex method that returns their respective types, the type checker cannot guarantee that the return type of obj.reindex is the exact same type as obj (i.e., T_Xarray).To illustrate this with a simplified example:Suppose we have two classes, A and B, and a generic type T that can be either A or B:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Both A and B have a method foo() that returns their respective types:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Now, if we have a function that takes an argument of type T and calls foo() on it:[CODE_BLOCK_2]The type checker has no guarantee that the returned type of obj.foo() is the same as T. This is because, from the type checker's perspective, T could be either A or B, and it cannot ensure that the type of obj.foo() matches the exact type of obj.This is why the cast is required in your code. By using cast(T_Xarray, ...), you're telling the type checker: ""Trust me, the returned type here is the same as T_Xarray"".In conclusion, even though it might seem obvious to us that the return type matches, the type checker cannot make that assumption based on the information provided. The cast is a way of providing an explicit guarantee to the type checker.",CLOSED,https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/8208,https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/8208#issuecomment-1724900027,comments.body,Here's a partial description of why we need `cast`s from GPT-4 — not completely satisfying from a `mypy` perspective though: https://chat.openai.com/share/5c1e3d71-ebf8-4bc1-a861-288d6dc83f55 ,pydata/xarray,8208,6,2,True,Negative

The method is named __getitem__, which is a special method in Python used for getting items for container types.Here's a high-level overview of the method's function:Normalization: It appears to support a variety of indexing methods, including:Standard integer-based indexing.Slicing.Ellipsis (...) to represent multiple colons.Fancy/tensor indexing (indexing with another tensor/array).Error Handling:It checks if too many indices have been provided.It ensures that only one ellipsis is used.Adjusting for Ellipsis: The ellipsis (...) is expanded into the appropriate number of slices (slice(None)).Handling Fancy Indexing: It identifies if any of the slices are actually tensors (fancy indexing) and stores their positions and values.Converting Integers to Slices: If an integer index is provided, it converts it to a slice for consistency in processing.Shrinking: The tensor is first ""shrunk"" based on the slices.Flipping: If any of the slices have a negative step, the tensor is flipped on those axes.Padding and Reshaping for Strides: If any of the slices have a stride other than 1, the tensor is padded and reshaped.Reshaping for Final Shape: The tensor is reshaped to its final shape, taking into account any fancy indexing.Handling Fancy Indexing: If fancy indexing was used, it handles it in this step.Returning the Result: The sliced tensor is returned.It's clear that this method is trying to implement a lot of the advanced indexing and slicing capabilities that you would find in libraries like NumPy or PyTorch. It seems to be a mix of both, with some unique adjustments.However, without the context of the rest of the class and the methods/attributes it uses (like shrink, flip, pad, reshape, shape, etc.), it's hard to say exactly how effective or correct this method is. It's also worth noting that some methods and attributes are not defined in this snippet (e.g., Tensor, dtypes.int32, self.device, etc.), so they are presumably part of the larger class or imported from elsewhere.Do you have any specific questions or concerns about this method?",MERGED,https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/1661,https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/1661#issuecomment-1692144992,comments.body,"Does GPT-4 have any good ideas?

This is using the https://api.monarchinitiative.org/api /sim/search endpoint, which can take either an array of phenotypes, or an array of gene/disease (whose phenotypes are used). If only phenotypes are given `is_feature_set` should be set to true.

This version implements both kinds of functionality, but only tells the model about the gene/disease search. In my initial test after requesting some phenotypes for a disease and then searching for similar diseases/genes, it chose to use the few phenotypes it had in hand rather than a disease->disease search. Generally it only pulls a few (5 to 10) phenotypes for an entity so we'll need to think more about implementing phenotype-array sim search, maybe with a different endpoint.

But, this implementation still trips the model up sometimes, as the search returns a mix of genes and diseases, see e.g. https://chat.openai.com/share/ed17cd4e-d32a-4162-b400-a01877f026d1",monarch-initiative/oai-monarch-plugin,39,1,0,True,Positive
145,0,What's a magic number in programming?,"ChatGPTIn programming, a ""magic number"" refers to a numeric literal that is used directly in the code without any explanation or clear context. These numbers are often arbitrary and lack proper documentation or meaningful variable names to indicate their purpose. Magic numbers can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and debug, as their purpose might not be immediately apparent to other developers (including your future self).Using magic numbers can lead to several issues:Readability and Maintenance: Code with magic numbers can be difficult to read and understand, especially for someone who didn't write the code. Without proper context, it's unclear why a specific number is used, what it represents, or what calculations are being performed.Error-Prone: If a magic number is used in multiple places within your code and you decide to change its value, you have to update it in all occurrences, which can lead to errors if you miss one or forget to update it consistently.Lack of Flexibility: Using magic numbers makes your code less flexible. If you need to adjust a value or parameter, you would have to find and change all occurrences of the magic number manually.Understanding and Debugging: When bugs or issues arise, it can be challenging to identify the source of the problem if you're dealing with magic numbers. Debugging becomes more complicated without clear variable names or comments explaining the purpose of the numbers.To mitigate the issues caused by magic numbers, it's a good practice to:Use Constants or Enumerations: Define constants or enumerations with meaningful names to represent these numbers. This improves code readability and allows you to change the value in a single place if needed.Add Comments: If using a magic number is unavoidable, add a comment explaining its significance and usage.Extract into Functions: If the number represents a specific calculation or operation, consider encapsulating that logic into a function with a descriptive name. This abstracts away the details and provides a clear interface for using that logic.By following these practices, you can make your code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone, enhancing the overall quality of your software.",MERGED,https://github.com/dswcodes0/StatChat/pull/30,https://github.com/dswcodes0/StatChat/pull/30#discussion_r1290326339,reviews.body,"It would be good to move ""3"" to a constant at the module level.

","ChatGPTIn Angular, you can detect if you're on a wildcard route in a parent layout component by using the ActivatedRoute service. The ActivatedRoute service provides various observables and snapshot properties that help you get route information. However, it is generally associated with the component that is directly linked with the route.For a parent layout component that may not be directly linked to a specific route, you could use Angular's Router service to detect the active route. Here's a simplified example using Angular's Router service:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, we listen to the router's events observable and filter it for instances of NavigationEnd, which signals that a route change has completed.We then traverse the ActivatedRoute tree to get to the most deeply nested active route, which is where wildcard routes would be defined. We check the routeConfig.path of this route's snapshot against '**', which is the path usually used for wildcard routes. If they match, we know we are on a wildcard route.This should give you a starting point to identify whether you're currently on a wildcard route from within a parent layout component.",MERGED,https://github.com/scania-digital-design-system/tegel-angular-demo/pull/51,https://github.com/scania-digital-design-system/tegel-angular-demo/pull/51#issuecomment-1706810955,comments.body,"> @alexandereneroth @mJarsater, started with the other route example you linked too.

151,0,how can I create muliple dataframes in python from one dataframe group by a date column?,"ChatGPTTo create multiple DataFrames in Python from one DataFrame by grouping it based on a date column, you can use the groupby() function from the pandas library. Here's an example of how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the groupby() function is used to group the DataFrame df by the 'date' column. The pd.Grouper() function is used to specify the frequency of grouping, in this case, 'D' for daily grouping. You can adjust the frequency based on your specific requirements, such as 'M' for monthly grouping or 'Y' for yearly grouping.Inside the loop, a new DataFrame named new_df is created for each group using the pd.DataFrame() constructor. You can perform any additional operations or analysis on each new DataFrame as needed.Note that the above example assumes you have a pandas DataFrame named 'df' with a column named 'date' containing datetime values. Adjust the code accordingly if your DataFrame or column names differ.",MERGED,https://github.com/RND247/Pype-Synthetic-Data-for-Testing/pull/16,https://github.com/RND247/Pype-Synthetic-Data-for-Testing/pull/16#discussion_r1221734095,reviews.body,"maybe use the groupby function in the dataframe class?

Compared to the first version there should be less categories. They are too fine-granular at the moment. Try to cut it down to 4-6 categories.
Prompts of first version were not ideal.

Overall there were several improvements to be made to the categorization method to be fully functional

Vague example of what i mean: https://chat.openai.com/share/48bd44b4-13a7-4ff8-9938-2214f0b17f6b
### How I implemented ( new by @thomas-woehrle  )

- adjusted getRepositoryTopics to return a list of strings rather than a string
- input to getCategoryByNumber is a list of topics and a description, but can be null
- call to GPT to get a number/multiple numbers for a project
- I use numbers instead of strings because this does leave no room for GPT to make up stuff like new category names
- transforms GPTs answer into a list of Categories

153,0,"I have a python package on pypi.
Does lowercase, upper case matter?","ChatGPTIn the context of Python packages on PyPI (Python Package Index), here's how casing matters:Package Name: Package names on PyPI are case-insensitive. This means that you cannot have two packages where the only difference is the casing. For example, if there's already a package named mypackage, you cannot upload another package named MyPackage or MYPACKAGE. However, when installing a package using pip, you can use any casing, and pip will normalize it. For instance, pip install mypackage, pip install MyPackage, and pip install MYPACKAGE would all install the same package.Package Content: Inside the package, the names of modules, classes, functions, and variables are case-sensitive, as they are in Python itself. For example, import mymodule and import MyModule would be treated as two different modules, and only one of them would work based on how the module is actually named in the package.Version Strings: Version strings are case-sensitive. For example, 1.0.0a1 and 1.0.0A1 would be considered different versions.Dependencies: When specifying dependencies in setup.py or pyproject.toml, the package names are case-insensitive, but the version specifiers are case-sensitive.URLs: URLs in general are case-sensitive (except for the domain part). However, when specifying URLs in the package metadata (like home page, repository, etc.), it's a good practice to use the exact URL as given by the hosting service.In summary, while package names on PyPI are case-insensitive, the content inside the package and other elements like version strings follow Python's standard case-sensitivity rules. Always be consistent with casing to avoid confusion.",MERGED,https://github.com/kolibril13/ipyMolecularNodes/pull/1,https://github.com/kolibril13/ipyMolecularNodes/pull/1#issuecomment-1738733725,comments.body,"good question!

Null characters are not allowed in string literals because they indicate the end of a string in C-style strings.To handle this error, you can use one of the following approaches:Remove or replace the null character: If the null character is not necessary for your string, you can remove it or replace it with another character.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Here, the replace() method is used to remove the null character from the string.Use a byte string (b-string) or raw string: If you need to work with strings that contain null characters, you can use byte strings or raw strings.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Byte strings are denoted by the b prefix, and they allow null characters in the string. Raw strings are denoted by the r prefix, and they treat backslashes as literal characters, so you can include null characters without any issue.Store the string in a file or database: If you need to preserve the null character within a larger dataset, you can store the string in a file or a database instead of a string literal.[CODE_BLOCK_2]By storing the string in a file, you can retain the null character without encountering the error.Choose the approach that best suits your requirements and the nature of the string containing the null character.",MERGED,https://github.com/roslinmahmud/easy-hire-backend/pull/11,https://github.com/roslinmahmud/easy-hire-backend/pull/11#issuecomment-1590933040,comments.body,"@roslinmahmud can you fix the the upload error when badly formatted resumes are uploaded?

Docker will use the Dockerfile in the current directory (denoted by the .) to build the image. If an image with the tag kaguya already exists, it will not be overwritten or deleted, but the kaguya tag will be moved to the newly built image. The old image will still exist and can be accessed by its image ID.However, Docker does use a build cache to speed up the build process. If the instructions in the Dockerfile and the context have not changed since the last build, Docker may reuse the results from the cache instead of executing the instructions again. This can make it seem like the image is not being rebuilt, but in reality Docker is just reusing parts of the previous build.

Here's a quick breakdown:useState and useMemo Hooks: Good use of these React hooks, keeping the component re-renders efficient.Options: You're collecting categories and formats without duplicates and sorting them. Looks neat.Filters: Clean way of setting up the filter groups. The usage of the filterControls array with two elements might not be super intuitive, though. Maybe consider an object with named properties for clarity?Filtered Events: Nice logic for applying the filters. No issues spotted.Readability: I'd add some comments, especially around the logic inside useMemo hooks. It would make it easier for others (or even future you) to understand.Change example:

166,0,How to rebase on master?,"ChatGPTIf you want to rebase a feature branch onto master, you're effectively moving the base of the feature branch to the latest commit in the master branch, and reapplying your changes from the feature branch on top of that. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing this with Git:Ensure you're on the feature branch: Before you start the rebase, make sure you're on the feature branch you want to rebase.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository: Before rebasing, it's a good idea to make sure you have the latest changes from the master branch.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Start the rebase process: Now, you can start the rebase onto master.[CODE_BLOCK_2]Resolve conflicts, if any: During the rebase process, you might encounter conflicts. If so:Edit the conflicting files to resolve the issues.After resolving the conflict in a file, mark the file as resolved using:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Once all conflicts are resolved, continue the rebase with:[CODE_BLOCK_4]If you want to abort the rebase and go back to where you were, you can use:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Push the rebased branch to the remote repository: Once the rebase is complete and you're satisfied with the changes, you can push the rebased branch to the remote repository. Since the history of the branch has changed due to the rebase, you'll need to use the --force option (use with caution).[CODE_BLOCK_6]Note: Rebasing rewrites the history of your commits. This can lead to problems if other people are also working on the same branch, as their history will differ from yours. It's usually a good idea to communicate with your team before doing a rebase and force push, especially on branches that are shared.",MERGED,https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda/pull/23,https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda/pull/23#issuecomment-1689687365,comments.body,"I also just learning the github workflow. At work we have bitbucket and plastic scm. That becomes annoying when you have multiple commits and you have conflicts on master. Also the reviewing sucks then.

So maybe lets stick with what we have for now and I just relax the squashing requirement. Most importantly, all commits to master have to compile. Then you can use bisect to find an issue in a very systematic way. But this should the reviewer also help to make sure.",MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda,23,10,2,True,Positive
167,0,Is there a way I can StreamElements Account IDs and twitch loginnames apart programmatically,"ChatGPTTo retrieve StreamElements account IDs and Twitch login names programmatically, you would typically need to interact with the StreamElements API and the Twitch API. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:Obtain API credentials: Register your application on both the StreamElements Developer Portal (https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/developer) and the Twitch Developer Portal (https://dev.twitch.tv/). This will give you the necessary API credentials (API keys, client IDs, and client secrets) to authenticate your requests.Authenticate with StreamElements API: Use your StreamElements API credentials to authenticate your requests. You'll typically need to make an OAuth authentication request to obtain an access token that allows you to access the user's StreamElements account details. Refer to StreamElements API documentation for the specific authentication process.Retrieve StreamElements Account ID: Once you have an authenticated request, you can make API calls to retrieve the StreamElements account ID associated with the user. The specific API endpoint or method for this may vary based on the StreamElements API documentation. Look for methods such as ""Get Account Details"" or similar.Authenticate with Twitch API: Use your Twitch API credentials to authenticate your requests. This will typically involve generating an access token using the OAuth flow provided by the Twitch API. Refer to the Twitch API documentation for the authentication process.Retrieve Twitch Login Name: With an authenticated request to the Twitch API, you can make API calls to retrieve the user's Twitch login name. This information is usually available through the Twitch API's user endpoints, such as ""Get User"" or similar.By following these steps and utilizing the StreamElements API and the Twitch API, you should be able to programmatically retrieve the StreamElements account ID and Twitch login name for a user. Keep in mind that the specific API endpoints and methods may vary, so consult the respective documentation for the most up-to-date information.",MERGED,https://github.com/Wissididom/Bonbon-Reminder-StreamElements/pull/1,https://github.com/Wissididom/Bonbon-Reminder-StreamElements/pull/1#discussion_r1241825224,reviews.body,"Maybe some logic like the one from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67744689/is-there-some-trick-to-programmatically-determine-whether-a-given-twitch-usernam to check if it is a twitch login name might be helpful.
ChatGPT also suggested following logic, that I'd consider implementing (probably adjusting it a little bit):
```javascript
function identifyString(string) {
  // Regular expression patterns for Twitch login names and StreamElements account IDs
  const twitchPattern = /^[A-Za-z0-9_]{4,25}$/;
  const streamelementsPattern = /^[a-fA-F0-9]{24}$/;

  if (twitchPattern.test(string)) {
    return ""Twitch login name"";
  } else if (streamelementsPattern.test(string)) {
    return ""StreamElements Account ID"";
  } else {
    return ""Unknown"";
  }
}

// Example usage
const string1 = ""mytwitchusername123"";
const string2 = ""5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3"";
const string3 = ""invalid_string"";

console.log(identifyString(string1));  // Output: Twitch login name
console.log(identifyString(string2));  // Output: StreamElements Account ID
console.log(identifyString(string3));  // Output: Unknown

```","ChatGPTOption A is generally better for a few reasons:It starts with ""What,"" which is arguably the most important information users are looking for when they review this table. They want to know what feature or change is being discussed, so it makes sense to list that first.The ""Description"" column, also highly important, is placed second, thus maintaining the focus on the feature/change itself.The ""When"" and ""Status"" columns are more administrative details, which are also important, but secondary to the ""What"" and ""Description.""Lastly, this ordering matches the general reading flow in English (and many other languages), from left to right. This means that the eye is naturally drawn first to the ""What"" and ""Description"" columns, then moves over to ""When"" and ""Status.""Option B might be more suitable if the timing (""When"") or the status of the feature/change is more important to the users than what the feature/change is, which is generally not the case for a product roadmap or changelog.In the end, it comes down to the audience. If you think the timing or status is more important to your users, then Option B might be better.

for someone reading the readme on balance i think aim here should be to ""whet their appetite"" hence focusing on the ""what"" first make most sense on balance. I think doing ""when"" first assumes they actually maybe already have an idea of what the when refers to which is less likely i think to be the case here (my assumption being 9 times out of 10 this will be the first time they are consuming the row of information).

}","ChatGPTYour existing implementation already has a lot of the functionality you're seeking. The Game class has methods to interact with localStorage, get and set user data, and display results.However, to render the contents of localStorage on every page load, you need to make sure you call the initialize() function at the start of each page load. It seems your code currently only creates a new instance of the Game class, but it does not call the initialize() function unless initializeImmediately is set to true.Update the last few lines in your game.js file as follows to call the initialize() function whenever a new Game instance is created:[CODE_BLOCK_0]By passing true as an argument when creating a new Game instance, you're enabling immediate initialization, which includes displaying the current user and the backfilled results.Regarding unit tests, here is an example of how you might write tests to check these functionalities using a testing framework like Jest:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Note: You would need to adjust the tests depending on the specifics of your implementation and the testing environment.

https://chat.openai.com/share/77d5c38a-4e11-40c3-b827-6e1cb9eae291

I apologize if my previous responses may have been unclear. The reason for the uncertainty is that from the provided index.html and game.js files, it wasn't explicitly clear how the game is being initialized on page load. Usually, the game initialization logic would be placed in a separate script file that is referenced in your HTML, or directly in a script tag within the HTML itself. However, this isn't present in the provided index.html.

Given your index.html and game.js, I'm assuming the Game class is being automatically initialized upon import of the game.js file. As I suggested earlier, one approach is to create a new initGame function in your game.js file which initializes the game:

```javascript
// game.js

// ... existing code ...

export function initGame() {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        window.game = new Game(true);
    }
}
```

And then in your index.html, add a script to call this function when the window is loaded:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!-- ... existing code ... -->

<script type=""module"">
import { initGame } from './game.js';

window.onload = function() {
    initGame();
};
</script>
```

Now, the game will be initialized when the window loads, and not just when game.js is imported. You should update your tests to reflect this new initialization logic.

172,0,I'm looking at some logging code that uses Slf4j's MDC to keep track of some extra context.  I'm in a highly concurrent environment though & MDC will carry its own risks.  Can I setup the same context directly through a log.atLevel()... fluent approach?,"ChatGPTSLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) provides the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) feature to associate metadata with current thread logs. This is especially helpful for tasks like tracking user sessions across application layers. However, in highly concurrent environments, especially when dealing with asynchronous programming (like using CompletableFuture, reactive streams, etc.), thread-local storage like MDC can be problematic.Let me explain the potential issues with MDC in asynchronous contexts:Thread-local Leakage: If thread-local variables are not cleaned up before a thread is reused (as in thread pools), there can be unintended leakage of the MDC values from one task to another.Lost Context: In asynchronous operations, the thread handling the initial part of a request might be different from the one handling the continuation. Thus, the MDC values can get lost if not explicitly propagated.If you're using the Logback logging framework (a popular choice with SLF4J), Logback does provide some utilities to assist with this, like the LogbackMDCAdapter which helps to manage MDC values.Now, as for your specific question about using a fluent approach with log.atLevel()..., you're probably referring to the newer, more fluent logging APIs (like the one introduced in Log4j 2).With the fluent approach, you can directly attach context data to a log message without storing it in a thread-local storage. Here's a basic example using Log4j 2:[CODE_BLOCK_0]To achieve this with SLF4J, you'd need to integrate or extend it with a logging framework that supports this fluent style.If you can switch or are already using Log4j 2, then it provides these capabilities out of the box. Otherwise, if you're committed to SLF4J, and if it doesn't natively support the feature you want (depending on the underlying logging framework), you might have to write some custom utility or wrapper to make it more fluent and context-aware without relying on MDC.A final note: If you decide to continue using MDC in asynchronous contexts, consider tools/libraries/frameworks like ContextAwareExecutorService or solutions like Project Reactor's Context (for reactive programming) to help propagate context correctly.",MERGED,https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/297,https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/297#discussion_r1318668172,reviews.body,"See the comment at the top-level.  Since MDC is handled as a ThreadLocal, this is going to be tech-debt that is extremely difficult to track and diagnose.

From a logging config management perspective, the MDC key/values can be handled fluently.  See https://chat.openai.com/share/08649025-20e3-42e6-abba-32c29722dc0c and https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/280",opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations,297,3,1,True,Neutral

2. However, the PR does not seem to implement any logic to prevent the bot from undoing user actions.

Similarly, there's no code related to labels and their potential removal by the bot.

In conclusion:

- The PR partially addresses the requirements by refining the logic for ""last activity time.""
- It does not fully satisfy the requirements regarding the bot undoing user actions (e.g., unassigning users or removing labels).

To fully satisfy the requirements, the PR would need additional logic to ensure the bot respects user actions like assigning users or adding labels.

175,0,Teach me about n8n,"ChatGPTn8n (pronounced ""n-eight-n"") is a free and open-source node-based workflow automation tool. It allows you to connect and automate different services and systems, often with little to no code. It was designed to help automate tasks and workflows, making processes more efficient and data-driven.Here are some key features and concepts associated with n8n:Nodes and Workflows: In n8n, a node represents a software or a service like Gmail, Slack, or even HTTP requests. By combining nodes in different ways, you create what's known as a workflow. A workflow can represent a whole automated process like, ""When I receive an email (Gmail node), post a message in Slack (Slack node).""Triggers and Actions: Nodes can either act as triggers (starting points of workflows) or actions (steps that do something like sending emails or manipulating data).Open Source and Self-hosted: One key aspect of n8n is that it's open source, meaning its code is freely available to use, modify, and distribute. Additionally, it's self-hosted. Instead of running on a vendor's server, you can run it on your own server. This has implications for data privacy because data stays within your control.Web-based Interface: n8n provides a web-based interface, making it relatively easy to create and visualize workflows.Built-in OAuth and API Key Support: n8n has built-in support for popular authorization methods, such as OAuth and API keys, making it easier to connect with different services.Extensibility: Because it's open source, you can extend n8n with new functionality or even add nodes for services that aren't supported out of the box.Integration: As of my last update in September 2021, n8n had support for over 200 different services and systems.To use n8n, you need some basic knowledge about APIs, webhooks, and data formats like JSON. Depending on the complexity of the workflows and integrations, more technical expertise might be required.",MERGED,https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/pull/897,https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/pull/897#discussion_r1249738353,reviews.body,"Will we keep history of changes?

When a user indicates that they're enjoying the app, the developer might prompt them to leave a positive review on the app store. This tactic can help an app accumulate more positive reviews, which can lead to better visibility in app store rankings.However, both Apple and Google have policies against this practice as they aim to get unbiased reviews from users. Specifically, Apple's App Store Review Guidelines state: ""Don’t directly or indirectly discourage users from making negative reports or reviews"" (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021).This means that apps shouldn't only direct happy users to the app store to leave reviews, but should give all users the same opportunity. If a developer uses review gating and Apple finds out, the app could be rejected or removed from the App Store.Google Play Store has similar policies.So while it may be tempting to try to boost your positive reviews this way, it's important to follow the guidelines and rules set by the app stores to avoid potential issues.

","ChatGPTCreating an image proxy with a maximum size limit is a prudent choice to prevent abuse or accidental server strain from extremely large files. When determining a default size, it's important to consider both common use cases and the potential for larger images among the MIME types you provided.Here are some observations and recommendations based on the provided MIME types:Most Common Image Types:'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg': High-resolution photos can get pretty large, especially if they're not optimized. An average high-res JPEG could be between 1MB to 5MB.'image/png': PNGs can vary in size. While most web PNGs might be under 1MB, it's not uncommon to encounter larger PNGs, especially if they're screenshots or have a high resolution.'image/webp': WebP is a modern image format that's typically more compressed than JPEG or PNG. However, its size can vary based on its content.'image/gif': Animated GIFs can be quite large. A lengthy or high-quality animated GIF can easily be several megabytes in size.Specialized or Less Common Image Types:'image/vnd.adobe.photoshop': Photoshop (PSD) files can be very large, especially if they contain many layers. A multi-layered design could easily exceed 100MB.'image/tiff': TIFF files are typically used for high-quality scans or photography. They can get very large, potentially exceeding 100MB for high-resolution images.'image/vnd.djvu', 'image/vnd.dwg', 'image/vnd.dxf': These formats are specialized (e.g., CAD drawings) and can vary in size. Some can be relatively small, while others can be quite large, especially if they're complex or detailed.Icon or Small Image Types:'image/vnd.microsoft.icon', 'image/x-icon': These are icon formats and are typically quite small, often under 100KB.'image/vnd.wap.wbmp': WBMP is a monochrome image format typically used for mobile. They're usually small.Miscellaneous: The remaining formats have various use cases and their sizes can vary. Some, like 'image/bmp', can be large if the resolution is high.Recommendation:If you want to support a wide range of use cases, including allowing high-res photos, some animations, and general web images, but excluding very large files like large TIFFs or PSDs, then a limit of 5MB to 10MB might be reasonable as a default.If you're also considering the potential of serving designers or professionals who might be working with larger files, you could consider a higher default like 50MB.However, regardless of the default, it would be wise to allow users (or developers, if this is a tool for other developers) to set their own limit based on their needs.",MERGED,https://github.com/rehypejs/camomile/pull/1,https://github.com/rehypejs/camomile/pull/1#discussion_r1327316181,reviews.body,"> Q1: I prefer the name `Options` for such types.

Take into account that a lock file from npm is used too.","ChatGPTWhen you use a package manager like npm or yarn and specify versions in your package.json, the way you specify versions can impact which versions of packages get installed and how upgrades are handled. Here are some things to consider:Version Semantics:Using ^2.1.0 means: Install the latest minor or patch version greater than or equal to 2.1.0 but less than 3.0.0.Using ^2.0.0 means: Install the latest minor or patch version greater than or equal to 2.0.0 but less than 3.0.0.The major difference here is the starting version. If you've specifically started with 2.1.0, there's likely a reason (perhaps a feature or fix that isn't available in 2.0.0). Rounding down to 2.0.0 could potentially introduce issues if the later version was required.Lock File:When you have a lock file (like package-lock.json for npm or yarn.lock for yarn), the exact versions of the dependencies at the time of the last installation are locked. This means that even if your package.json says ^2.1.0 and a 2.2.0 version is released, you won't get that version on a fresh npm install unless you explicitly update.The main advantage of the lock file is reproducibility. Everyone who clones the repository and runs npm install will get the same exact versions of the dependencies, which minimizes ""it works on my machine"" problems.Benefit of ""Rounding"":If you're considering rounding to a major version without any specific reason (e.g., from ^2.1.0 to ^2.0.0), there isn't a direct tangible benefit.It might make your package.json look cleaner or more aesthetic to some, but functionally it can even be a disadvantage if the minor or patch versions introduced crucial fixes or features that your application depends on.Package Updates:Rounding might cause you to miss out on important bug fixes or features from later minor versions. If you're used to updating frequently, this may not be a big deal. But if you rarely update, you could be missing out.Risks:The risk of downgrading to rounded versions is that you may unintentionally downgrade a package to a version that contains a bug, lacks a feature you rely on, or even introduces breaking changes in some cases.In conclusion, while there's no direct technical benefit of rounding versions in package.json (and there could be disadvantages), there might be aesthetic or organizational reasons someone chooses to do so. If you have a lock file and are consistently committing it to your repository, the precise versions in package.json are less critical for reproducibility, but they still guide updates and fresh installations. It's always good to be intentional and understand the implications when choosing package versions.",MERGED,https://github.com/rehypejs/camomile/pull/1,https://github.com/rehypejs/camomile/pull/1#discussion_r1327365353,reviews.body,"I don't understand why you would do this.

I think it is related to gcc vs clang. `p` is declared as `int64_t *`.","ChatGPTThe warnings you are encountering when using scanf are related to format specifiers not matching the type of the pointer you're using. To fix this issue and ensure your code is portable across different platforms (Linux with GCC and macOS with Clang), you should use the correct format specifier for int64_t and make sure you pass a pointer to the appropriate type.On most platforms, including Linux with GCC and macOS with Clang, int64_t is a 64-bit integer type, so you should use the %lld format specifier.

This would block all outgoing requests.After the build step, run another step to restore the network connectivity by flushing the iptables rules.Here's how your modified workflow would look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Some explanations:The sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP command sets the default policy for the OUTPUT chain to DROP, effectively cutting off internet access for outgoing requests.The sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT command allows local connections to be maintained (e.g., localhost).The sudo iptables -F command flushes the iptables rules, restoring the previous network connectivity.The if: always() condition for the ""Restore Internet"" step ensures that it always runs, regardless of whether the previous step succeeded or failed.Do note, however, that you might need to ensure that your runner has iptables installed.

195,0,"If I implement a List.filter function in a functional programming language, what are the relative merits of using a recursive implementation, vs using List.fold?","ChatGPTBoth recursion and List.fold are commonly used approaches to implementing operations like List.filter in functional programming languages. Each method has its own merits and potential downsides. Here's a breakdown of each:Recursive ImplementationAdvantages:Readability: Recursive implementations can often be more readable and intuitive, especially for operations that are inherently recursive like tree traversals.Simplicity: No need to understand the semantics of higher-order functions like List.fold. This makes it easier for someone unfamiliar with these functions to understand the code.Tail-Recursion: Some functional programming languages can optimize tail-recursive functions, which can offer performance benefits.Disadvantages:Error-Prone: It's easy to make mistakes in recursive implementations like forgetting a base case, which can lead to infinite recursion or stack overflows.Potential for Non-Tail-Recursion: Not all recursive functions can be written in a tail-recursive manner, which could lead to stack overflow errors for large lists.Using List.foldAdvantages:Abstraction: List.fold abstracts away the pattern of iterating over a list and accumulating a result. This can make the code easier to understand once you're familiar with folding.Code Reuse: Using a standard library function like List.fold reduces the amount of custom code you need to write and test.Functional Idiom: List.fold is a functional idiom that many functional programmers will recognize and understand quickly.Potential for Optimization: Standard library functions like List.fold are often highly optimized. Additionally, using such standard functions can enable further compiler optimizations.Disadvantages:Learning Curve: Understanding List.fold can be difficult for newcomers to functional programming.Debugging: Debugging can be more difficult when using higher-order functions like List.fold because you're adding another layer of abstraction.Readability: For very simple filtering criteria, using List.fold might appear as overkill and actually hamper readability.Performance Overheads: While generally optimized, the use of a higher-order function can introduce slight performance overhead due to function calls, though this is usually negligible.ConclusionBoth methods are valid and can be used effectively to implement List.filter.

201,0,Can you make typescript interfaces?,"ChatGPTYes, I can help you with TypeScript interfaces. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing capabilities to the language. Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure and shape of objects, specifying the names and types of properties and methods that an object should have.Here's an example of how you can create TypeScript interfaces:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the example above, we defined an interface called Person with three properties: name, age, and email. The name property is of type string, the age property is of type number, and the email property is optional (? denotes optional properties).We then created an object person that conforms to the Person interface. We assigned values to the name and age properties. Since the email property is optional, we omitted it in this case.You can also use interfaces to define the structure of functions:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In this example, we defined an interface called MathFunction that describes a function with two parameters of type number and a return type of number. We then created a function add that conforms to this interface and performs addition.Interfaces in TypeScript are powerful tools for creating well-defined object structures and ensuring type safety.

go over the above code in steps that make sense, don't say as a first pass if they can be optimized, just look at them and express some written thoughts that may help you in the second step. 

First step first, then you ask me to move on to step two. Be very detailed, and VERY careful","ChatGPTLet's analyze the given kernel code carefully and step by step. Please note that I'm considering the reasoning part of the analysis and not yet moving to optimization suggestions.The function is declared as a kernel, indicating that this is a GPU kernel meant to be run on parallel threads.The function takes a lot of parameters including pointers to source and destination matrices, some constant values, and threadgroup information. This is not necessarily a problem, but too many parameters can sometimes make the function signature difficult to read and understand.The first lines of the code are initializing the values and pointers needed for the calculation.const int nb = ne00/QK_K; is calculating some constant nb, possibly the number of blocks.const int64_t r0 = tgpig.x; and const int64_t r1 = tgpig.y; are capturing the threadgroup position in the grid. tgpig is a uint2, so it represents an x and y position or a 2D coordinate.Next, it seems to be setting pointers to parts of the input data, x and yy, based on threadgroup positions.const uint nth = tptg.x*tptg.y; calculates the number of threads.const uint ith = tptg.y*tpitg.x + tpitg.y; calculates the thread index within the threadgroup.const int tid = tpitg.y;, const int il = tid/4;, and const int ir = tid%4; are defining more values likely used for indexing.const int n = 8; and const int is = 2*il; define further constants.sum[ith] = 0.0f; initializes the sum for the current thread to 0.The next block of code is the main computation part and contains a loop.float sumf = 0; initializes a local sum.The loop for (int i = tpitg.x; i < nb; i += tptg.x) is an interesting structure; it appears to be iterating over some blocks but with a step size dependent on the threadgroup size. This suggests that each iteration is probably operating on a different chunk of data in parallel.Inside the loop, we see various pointer manipulations and indexing into the input data.q, y, and scales are extracted from the input data.dall and dmin are extracted as well, and they are cast to float.Then there is an inner loop for (int l = 0; l < n; ++l) which seems to be doing some dot product or sum of products calculation using the previously extracted data. This is written into the vector s.After the inner loop, there is a final accumulation into sumf.The last part of the code deals with accumulating results from all threads in a threadgroup.There are three barriers here, which are synchronization points ensuring that all threads in the threadgroup have reached that point.There is a reduction pattern here, where partial sums are accumulated in a hierarchical manner.Finally, if ith is 0, which means this code is executed by only one thread, the final result is stored in the destination pointer dst.Now, let me know if you'd like to proceed to step two where I will discuss possible optimizations.",MERGED,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1775,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1775#issuecomment-1585648505,comments.body,"@ikawrakow It found something!!

First step first, then you ask me to move on to step two. Be very detailed, and VERY careful","ChatGPTAlright, let's perform an analysis on the code you provided. The code contains a helper function get_scale_min_k4 and a kernel kernel_mul_mat_q4_k_f32 which seems to be written in Apple's Metal Shading Language for GPU programming.Step 1: First Pass Analysisget_scale_min_k4 function: This function takes an integer j and a pointer q pointing to an array of uint8_t. The function is using bitwise operations to retrieve and manipulate the values stored at positions based on the value of j. The function returns a uchar4 vector with the manipulated values.Inside kernel_mul_mat_q4_k_f32:The function takes several inputs including pointers to input data (src0 and src1), a pointer for the output data (dst), several constant values, and thread-specific identifiers and counters. Notably, it uses shared memory with threadgroup for intermediate summations.const int nb = ne00/QK_K; computes the number of blocks needed, and it is dependent on the constant value ne00 and QK_K. The value QK_K is not defined in the snippet provided.Several values r0 and r1 are extracted from tgpig which seems to represent the thread group position in the grid. Similarly, ith is computed using thread-specific values, which will be different for different threads.Memory pointers x and yy are assigned to point to different locations based on r0 and r1 within src0 and src1.The inner loop iterates over blocks of data and uses a helper function get_scale_min_k4. Inside the loop, it seems to perform a computation involving scaling and summing the elements of two vectors.threadgroup_barrier function is used to synchronize all threads in a thread group. This is essential when using shared memory in GPU kernels.Finally, conditional statements are used to accumulate the sum from all threads in the thread group.This first pass analysis helps in understanding the structure and purpose of the kernel. The kernel seems to be performing some sort of matrix operation, as suggested by the name. The loop within the kernel is performing mathematical operations on data blocks, and there is a summation across threads in the thread group at the end.Step 2 would involve a more in-depth analysis, looking for optimization possibilities.Please let me know if you want to proceed to step 2.",MERGED,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1775,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1775#issuecomment-1585814548,comments.body,"@ikawrakow I realized that the reason GPT4 didn't detect the branch problem was because I had not included the get_scale_min_k4() function in the context.

What is the purpose of the ""native"" component?","ChatGPTThe ""native"" component in LLVM refers to the native code generation capabilities provided by the LLVM framework. It is responsible for translating the intermediate representation (IR) generated by LLVM into machine code that can be executed directly on the target hardware.The native component utilizes various optimization techniques, such as instruction selection, register allocation, and instruction scheduling, to generate efficient and optimized machine code. It takes into account the target architecture's specific features and optimizations to produce highly performant code.By providing native code generation, LLVM enables developers to write compiler frontends that target LLVM's IR and leverage LLVM's infrastructure for optimizing and generating machine code for a wide range of hardware architectures. This allows for portability and performance optimization across different platforms, making LLVM a versatile and powerful tool for compiler construction and code generation.",CLOSED,https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1788,https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1788#discussion_r1224635775,reviews.body,"What is the purpose of this change?

207,0,is it bad practice to use v-html in vue?,"ChatGPTUsing v-html in Vue.js to insert raw HTML into your templates can potentially lead to several issues:Security risk (XSS attacks): v-html can potentially open your application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if you're inserting HTML that was provided by users. This is the most significant risk associated with the use of v-html.Performance considerations: Vue's template compiler does a lot of optimizations during rendering, which v-html skips over. As a result, it might have an impact on performance if you're inserting a large amount of HTML.Loss of reactivity: Using v-html replaces the entire content of the node, so any Vue directives within the replaced content will stop working after the new HTML is inserted.Limited functionality: v-html just dumps the HTML into the element without offering any control over how the elements are bound to your data.Generally, it's better to use Vue's template system to generate HTML, because it provides you with many powerful, high-level features like directives, filters, computed properties, etc. If you find yourself needing to use v-html often, it might be worth revisiting your component design to see if there's a more ""Vue-ful"" way to accomplish your goals.However, in some scenarios where the content you're rendering is trusted, and where Vue's template syntax isn't sufficient (for example, if you're integrating with a WYSIWYG editor that spits out HTML), v-html might be a practical solution. Just be aware of the caveats and risks.

","ChatGPTHere are some differences between the kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32 and kernel_mul_mat_q5_k_f32 kernels and some suggestions that may help you debug the issues in kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32:Structures: The structures block_q3_k and block_q5_k have different layouts. For block_q3_k, the scale values are quantized with 6 bits, while for block_q5_k, it appears the scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits.Quantization Masking: In kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32, you are creating a mask and applying bitwise shifts and logical operations to extract relevant bits for quantization. In kernel_mul_mat_q5_k_f32, you are applying a different set of masks and shifts. Make sure that these masks and shifts are in line with how the data was originally quantized.Data Access Pattern: kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32 accesses x[i].scales as uint32_t, while kernel_mul_mat_q5_k_f32 accesses (x + i)->scales as uint16_t. Be sure that your data is aligned appropriately, and you are using the correct types for reading the values.Summing: The way summation is done over the scales seems different. In kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32, you are summing 4 elements and multiplying by dall, while in kernel_mul_mat_q5_k_f32, the summation seems to be more complicated, and there is also an additional variable dmin. Make sure that the summation and multiplication with scales are done in a way that is consistent with how the quantization was designed.Barriers and Accumulation: Both kernels are using threadgroup barriers and accumulating sums within threadgroups in a similar way, so this part seems mostly equivalent.Constants: The constants such as masks and shifts are different in both kernels which is expected if they are handling the data differently. However, you need to ensure that the constants used in kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32 are correct for your data and the way it was quantized.Debugging Suggestion: Debugging GPU kernels can be challenging. A good way to isolate issues is to progressively simplify the kernel until it becomes a minimal example that still reproduces the problem. You can start by setting static values instead of computing them, simplifying loops, etc.Attention to Detail: Make sure that the variables in the loop of kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32 that are being used to index or calculate addresses (such as q, h, y, etc.) are actually using the intended values. Any small typo or error can lead to unintended memory access patterns which might not necessarily cause a crash, but will cause incorrect behavior.Check the Input Data: Sometimes, the issue is not in the kernel code but in the way the data is fed into the kernel. Make sure that your input data is correctly formatted and aligned, and that any buffers you are using are correctly set up.",MERGED,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1807,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1807#issuecomment-1586554971,comments.body,"Congratulations on successfully implementing Q3_K!

The never type is used to ensure that all cases are handled and that new cases aren't forgotten. The technique is called Exhaustiveness checking in TypeScript.However, instead of using an inline arrow function, you could use a helper function to assert exhaustiveness. This would improve readability and remove the necessity for eslint disabling:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the assertNever function, we are throwing an error if an unexpected value is encountered. This could be useful during development because it would crash your application at the source of the problem if you forget to add a case when extending your provider. Of course, the thrown error would be a problem in a production application, so you need to make sure that your switch is exhaustive during testing and before deployment.",MERGED,https://github.com/dust-tt/dust/pull/508,https://github.com/dust-tt/dust/pull/508#discussion_r1217708758,reviews.body,Using a helper function could be a little cleaner: https://chat.openai.com/share/0c93321b-b553-430f-a06f-a6c82f56e4ee,dust-tt/dust,508,15,1,True,Positive

212,0,"What is an ""underfilled job title""?","ChatGPTAs of my last update in September 2021, the term ""underfilled job title"" is not a commonly used or standardized term in the field of human resources or job descriptions. It is possible that the term has emerged or evolved after my last update.However, based on the components of the term, we can infer a potential meaning:""Job title"": Refers to the specific name or label given to a particular position or role within an organization. For example, ""Software Engineer,"" ""Marketing Manager,"" ""Accountant,"" etc.""Underfilled"": Implies that the job title might not accurately reflect the full scope or level of responsibilities that an employee is actually handling. In other words, someone may be working beyond the tasks traditionally associated with that job title.From the inferred meaning, an ""underfilled job title"" could describe a situation where an employee's official job title does not adequately capture the extent of their job duties, skills, or contributions to the organization. This could occur for various reasons, such as:The employee has taken on additional responsibilities over time that are not reflected in their initial job title.The organization has not updated the job title to reflect changes in the role or the employee's growth.The company uses generic or outdated job titles that don't accurately represent the complexity of the work being performed.It's worth noting that a more common term in HR is ""job title inflation,"" which refers to the practice of using high-sounding or prestigious job titles for positions that may not warrant such a grand designation. This is often done to make the job seem more appealing to candidates or to boost employee morale. However, ""underfilled job title"" seems to suggest the opposite situation.If you encounter the term ""underfilled job title"" in a specific context or organization, it would be best to seek clarification from that source to fully understand its intended meaning.",MERGED,https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/581,https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/581#issuecomment-1660232892,comments.body,"To me, underfilled job title is a column that gives more specific information about the job title.

215,0,"as best practise, should you import with .js sufix","ChatGPTIn JavaScript, whether to include the .js suffix when importing modules depends on the specific syntax and context of your code. Here are some guidelines:Importing ES6 Modules (recommended):
If you are using ES6 module syntax to import modules, you should not include the .js suffix. Here's how you typically import modules in ES6:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this case, modulePath should point to the JavaScript module file (without the .js extension). The browser or Node.js environment will automatically look for the module and append .js if necessary.Importing CommonJS Modules (Node.js):
In Node.js, when using CommonJS modules (e.g., require), you don't include the .js extension either. Node.js will resolve and load the module correctly. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Importing External Libraries:
When importing third-party libraries or packages, you usually specify the module name without the .js extension. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Importing Other File Types:
If you are importing non-JavaScript files, such as JSON, CSS, or other assets, you might need to include the file extension. For instance:[CODE_BLOCK_3]In summary, including the .js suffix when importing JavaScript modules is generally unnecessary and not recommended in modern JavaScript development, especially when using ES6 module syntax.

It does this by first finding the bounding rectangle of all the points of the polygons. Then it computes the center of that rectangle (which may not be on any of the polygons). Finally, it generates a point based on a gaussian distribution with the center as the mean and a third of the width and height as the standard deviation.However, the Gaussian (or normal) distribution is not restricted to a specific range - it can theoretically generate any number from negative infinity to positive infinity. While the numbers it generates are more likely to be close to the mean, there's still a chance they could be beyond the minimum and maximum coordinates of the polygons, which means the point it generates might not land on the polygons at all.To fix this, you might want to generate a point that is definitely within one of the polygons. You could do this by picking a random polygon and then a random point within that polygon. For simplicity, let's assume that these polygons are triangles. Then you can generate a random point within a triangle using barycentric coordinates:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This function first chooses a random triangle from the set of triangles. Then it generates two random numbers between 0 and 1. These numbers are used as barycentric coordinates to generate a point that is guaranteed to be within the chosen triangle.",CLOSED,https://github.com/OSRSB/OsrsBot/pull/301,https://github.com/OSRSB/OsrsBot/pull/301#issuecomment-1629870686,comments.body,"https://chat.openai.com/share/633e2b6f-6e7b-43e7-8a8a-7fbe47c0aa4b

219,0,"in python, how get the result of exec()","ChatGPTIn Python, the exec() function is used to execute dynamically created program, which is either a string or object code. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed. If it is an object code, it is simply executed.The exec() function does not return any value, hence you can't directly get a result from it like you would from a function that returns a value.However, the exec() function optionally takes a globals and locals parameter (both must be dictionaries), which it uses for global and local variables during execution. If you want to get a result from exec, you can pass a dictionary for locals, execute an assignment statement, and then retrieve the result from the locals dictionary.Here is a small example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the code to be executed is a string that declares two variables a and b and a third variable result which is the sum of a and b. After executing this code with exec, the locals_ dictionary is updated with the values of a, b, and result, and you can get the value of result by looking it up in the dictionary.Please note, using exec() can potentially make your code vulnerable to code injection if you are executing code that comes from an untrusted source or includes user inputs. It is generally best to avoid using exec() if possible.",MERGED,https://github.com/pyspark-ai/pyspark-ai/pull/1,https://github.com/pyspark-ai/pyspark-ai/pull/1#discussion_r1231396472,reviews.body,"https://chat.openai.com/share/0b7b9fec-30b4-40dd-b887-fb7328f303f2

230,0,"Why use :key=""route.path"" on router-view in vue 3","ChatGPTChatGPTThe :key=""route.path"" attribute on a router-view component in Vue 3 is used to ensure that the component is re-rendered whenever the route changes.By default, Vue.js tries to be efficient by reusing components where it can. This is usually a good thing, but there are cases where this behavior is not desirable. For example, when navigating between different routes that use the same component, by default, Vue does not recreate the component - it reuses the existing instance of the component. This can cause problems if you are doing any kind of setup or initialization in your component's created or mounted lifecycle methods, because these methods will not be called again when the route changes.Using :key=""route.path"" is a way to tell Vue to recreate the component whenever the route changes. When the route changes, the route.path value will change, and because the key attribute is bound to this value, Vue will destroy the old component and create a new one, ensuring that all setup and initialization code in the component's lifecycle methods is run again.This can be useful for resetting component state, re-fetching data, or simply making sure that the user gets a ""fresh"" instance of the component when navigating between routes.",MERGED,https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/pull/3937,https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/pull/3937#discussion_r1208450760,reviews.body,"https://chat.openai.com/share/85cec841-8282-4af9-a7f2-8be481f66fc1

This has a bug, where ""Émile"" is not selected as the displayed creator when ""E"" is the selected filter letter.","ChatGPTThe problem seems to be related to the toUpperCase() method and the handling of diacritical marks.

As a result, when you check if ""ÉMILE"".startsWith(""E""), you get false.To solve this problem, you can normalize the string to remove diacritical marks using the normalize() method with the ""NFD"" form, which splits an accented letter into the ASCII letter and a separate diacritic. You can then remove the diacritics using a regular expression that matches all non-ASCII characters. Here's how you can do it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, normalize(""NFD"") splits each accented character into its ASCII base and a diacritic, then replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, """") removes the diacritics (which are in the Unicode range 0300-036F).

This operation will cost 5000 gas per non-zero storage slot that's set to zero. So, if all fields in constructorParams were previously set, you would get some gas refunded.constructorParams.owner = address(0);: This code only resets the owner field of constructorParams to zero. If the owner was previously set, you would get 15000 - 5000 = 10000 gas refunded.Given this, if all fields of constructorParams were previously set, the first version (delete constructorParams;) would be more gas efficient because it would result in more gas being refunded.However, if only the owner field was previously set, then the two versions would be equivalent in terms of gas usage, because only one field is being set to zero in each case.Lastly, if none of the fields were previously set (and therefore no gas can be refunded), then the second version (constructorParams.owner = address(0);) would be more gas efficient, because it only sets one field to zero rather than all fields.Remember, setting a storage slot from zero to non-zero costs more gas than the opposite. If you set a previously non-zero storage slot back to zero, some gas is refunded. You can refer to the Ethereum Yellow Paper or resources like the Gas Station for the precise costs as they can change depending on network conditions and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the above information is accurate.

In the section 2.1.2 ""Camera with Distortion Model"", it explains how the radial and tangential distortion coefficients (R1, R2, R3, T1, T2) are used in the distortion model.The radial distortion coefficients (R1, R2, R3) and the tangential distortion coefficients (T1, T2) are used to correct for lens distortions in the image. The radial distortion is due to the spherical shape of the lens, causing rays of light to bend more at the edges of the lens than at the center. The tangential distortion is due to the lens and the image plane not being parallel.However, the page does not provide specific information on how to adjust these parameters if the resolution of an image is halved on both the vertical and horizontal.In general, if the resolution of an image is halved, the pixel coordinates of the image points will also be halved. This means that the distortion will be less pronounced in the lower-resolution image, as the distortion is typically more severe at the edges of the image.

This makes no consideration of the properties of the actual camera lens, which introduces its own image distortion subtly different than may be expected in the pinhole camera model. These distortions may be especially pronounced with fisheye cameras or zoom lenses at larger focal lengths:

I haven't checked the math, but I believe they may be defined however, by mathematical formula(s) involving the original parameter and an arbitrary scale value `n` (see the last entry [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/f35a1b48-461c-4dd6-bd44-f19d0fdbe45c))

This scale ratio may likely be used as `n` for the equations listed above.

> > > 
> > > 1. **Undistort the pixel coordinates**: The first step is to correct the distorted pixel coordinates to undistorted pixel coordinates. This is typically done using an iterative process, as the distortion equations are nonlinear and do not have a simple inverse. You might start with an initial guess for the undistorted coordinates (for example, the distorted coordinates), and then repeatedly apply the distortion model and adjust the coordinates until the distorted coordinates match the observed coordinates. The distortion model equations are given by:
> > > 
> > >     xdistorted = x(1 + k1*r^2 + k2*r^4 + k3*r^6) + [2 * p1 * x * y + p2 * (r^2 + 2 * x^2)]

> > > 
> > >     Here, (x, y) are the undistorted pixel locations in normalized image coordinates, (xdistorted, ydistorted) are the distorted pixel locations, r^2 = x^2 + y^2, and k1, k2, k3, p1, and p2 are the distortion coefficients.
> > > 
> > > 2. **Normalize the pixel coordinates**: Subtract the principal point coordinates (cx, cy) from the undistorted pixel coordinates, and divide by the focal length (fx, fy) to convert the pixel coordinates to normalized image coordinates. This will give you the coordinates (x, y) of the point in the camera's image plane, in units of the focal length.
> > > 
> > >     xnormalized = (xundistorted - cx) / fx
> > >     ynormalized = (yundistorted - cy) / fy
> > > 
> > > 3. **Convert to angles**: The normalized image coordinates (xnormalized, ynormalized) represent the tangent of the angles from the principal axis. So you can use the arctangent function to convert these coordinates to angles. The horizontal angle θx is given by θx = atan(xnormalized), and the vertical angle θy is given by θy = atan(ynormalized).
> > > 
> > > Please note that these angles are relative to the principal axis of the camera, which is the line from the camera center through the principal point. The angles are positive in the direction of increasing pixel coordinates, and are measured in radians. The horizontal angle is zero for points on the principal axis, positive for points to the right of the principal axis, and negative for points to the left. Similarly, the vertical angle is zero for points on the principal axis, positive for points below the principal axis (since y-coordinates increase downwards in image coordinates), and negative for points above.

However, it is possible to approximate the inverse using a series expansion, or to solve for the undistorted coordinates using a numerical method such as Newton's method.

It also requires choosing a suitable tolerance and maximum number of iterations. If the method does not converge, it may be necessary to try a different initial guess or to use a different numerical method.

241,0,How can I implement a health check in Docker Compose for Keycloak 21?,"ChatGPTTo implement a health check for Keycloak 21 in Docker Compose, you can use the healthcheck configuration option available in Docker Compose version 2.1 or higher. The healthcheck option allows you to define a command or script that Docker will periodically run to check the health of a container.Here's an example of how you can implement a health check for Keycloak 21 in Docker Compose:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example:We define a service named keycloak.We specify the Keycloak Docker image (jboss/keycloak:11.0.0 in this case).We map the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080 to access Keycloak.We define the healthcheck configuration block for the keycloak service.In the test field, we specify the command [""CMD"", ""curl"", ""-f"", ""http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/master""]. This command uses curl to make an HTTP request to Keycloak's /auth/realms/master endpoint. The -f flag ensures that curl returns a non-zero exit code if the request fails.We set the interval to 30s, indicating that Docker should run the health check every 30 seconds.We set the timeout to 10s, specifying the maximum time Docker waits for the health check command to complete.We set the retries to 5, which means Docker will attempt the health check command up to 5 times before considering the container unhealthy.With this configuration, Docker will periodically run the curl command to check the health of the Keycloak container. If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code) or exceeds the specified timeout, Docker will consider the container unhealthy.",MERGED,https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/22429,https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/22429#issuecomment-1577734656,comments.body,"@BrayanMnz It seems the health check you've switched to isn't working.

They are used to specify alternative schemas that a given value must conform to.Here's the difference between oneOf and anyOf:oneOf: It specifies that a value must match exactly one of the provided schemas. In other words, the value must adhere to the constraints of exactly one of the defined schemas. If a value matches multiple schemas, it would be considered invalid. It enforces a mutually exclusive choice.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the above example, the value must either be a string with a maximum length of 5 or a number greater than or equal to 10.anyOf: It specifies that a value must match at least one of the provided schemas. The value can conform to any of the defined schemas, allowing for multiple valid options. If a value matches multiple schemas, it is considered valid.Example:[CODE_BLOCK_1]In the above example, the value can be a string with a maximum length of 5 or a number greater than or equal to 10.

247,0,"I am working in an angular component and I am doing this:

<li (click)=""someMethod($event)"">Some Text</li>

But I have concern if the accesibility of this, is this accesible?","ChatGPTThe way you've implemented the click event on a list item (li) is not ideal from an accessibility standpoint.Here's why:Keyboard Accessibility: Click events will not work with keyboard navigation, which is an issue for people who navigate using a keyboard rather than a mouse. An a or button tag automatically comes with keyboard events (like onKeyPress) which are important for accessibility.Screen Readers: Screen readers expect certain HTML elements to have certain roles. By default, li elements aren't expected to be interactive. This means a screen reader may not communicate to the user that the list item is a clickable control. If you were using a button or a tag, the screen reader would automatically inform the user of its interactivity.The best way to ensure accessibility is to use the appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose. If you need a clickable element, use a button or a tag. If you need to style these elements to look different, you can do so using CSS.Here is an example with a button:[CODE_BLOCK_0]If you have a link, then you can do this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This way, you're making your Angular component more accessible by ensuring that it works for both mouse users and keyboard-only users, and is correctly announced by screen readers.",MERGED,https://github.com/dotCMS/core/pull/25432,https://github.com/dotCMS/core/pull/25432#discussion_r1256484668,reviews.body,`<li>` are not clickables elements this have a11y issues.

It appears that you've provided a set of axioms and relationships pertaining to biological entities, especially anatomical structures and cells. This looks like a part of an ontology, which is a formal way to describe types, properties, and interrelationships of entities in a specific domain—in this case, likely biology or anatomy.

However, there seems to be a recurring logical issue in your ontology, particularly related to the term ""coelemic cavity lumen"". You have ""coelemic cavity lumen"" as a subclass of ""luminal space of some coelom,"" and ""luminal space of"" is in the domain of ""immaterial entity."" However, ""anatomical entity"" is a subclass of ""material entity,"" and ""material entity"" is disjoint with ""immaterial entity.""

 ","ChatGPTBoth of these functions perform the same operation, which is to calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) for two sets of bounding boxes. IoU is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes. It is used in object detection to measure the accuracy of the model.Here are the main differences:Language and Library: The first function box_iou is written using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework that utilizes GPUs. The second function box_iou_batch is written using NumPy, a popular library for numerical computations in Python.Box Dimensions: Both functions expect the bounding boxes to be represented in the format (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max). However, the first function expects the boxes to be tensors and the second function expects the boxes to be numpy arrays.Array Broadcasting: In the first function, unsqueeze is used to add an extra dimension to the box tensors to make them broadcastable for the operations that follow. In the second function, the None index is used to add an extra dimension to the box arrays for the same purpose.Clamping vs Clipping: Both functions calculate the intersection area of the boxes by first finding the dimensions of the intersecting rectangle and then taking the product of these dimensions. The first function uses clamp_ to ensure that the dimensions are at least 0 (since negative dimensions would not make sense), while the second function uses clip for the same purpose.Division by Zero: In the calculation of the IoU, the intersection area is divided by the union area. If the union area is zero, this would result in a division by zero. The first function adds a small constant (eps) to the denominator to prevent this, while the second function relies on the fact that the numerator would also be zero in this case, resulting in a NaN value which is acceptable in this context.In-place Operations: The first function uses in-place operations (clamp_ and prod) on tensors to save memory, while the second function does not use in-place operations.In conclusion, while both functions perform the same operation, they do so using different languages and libraries, and with slightly different methods and considerations. The choice between them would depend on the specific requirements of your project, such as whether you are using PyTorch or NumPy, whether you are working with tensors or arrays, and how you want to handle edge cases like zero union area.",MERGED,https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/177,https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/177#issuecomment-1643969353,comments.body,"@kirilllzaitsev Could you share the input that you used?

First step first, then you ask me to move on to step two. Be very detailed, and VERY careful","ChatGPTI see that you have posted three kernel functions, namely kernel_mul_mat_q2_k_f32, kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32, and kernel_mul_mat_q4_k_f32. You mentioned that there is an issue with kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32. Let me analyze this particular function.The code in kernel_mul_mat_q3_k_f32 is quite complex and dense. It seems to be performing a highly parallelized computation on matrices, potentially with some form of quantization. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue without more context or understanding of the expected behavior. However, here are a few pointers that might help in debugging:Type Casting and Bit Manipulation: There are several bit manipulations and type casts involved in this kernel. Please double-check if they are as per your intended behavior. For example, the line const char4 sc1 = as_type<char4>(utmp[0]); casts an uint32_t to a char4 type. Make sure the bit manipulations are producing the desired results and not causing unintended side-effects.Memory Accesses: Make sure the accesses to the arrays x, y, q, hm, etc., are within bounds. Out-of-bounds memory accesses can cause undefined behavior or crashes. In particular, check the calculation of the indices.Thread Synchronization: The kernel uses barriers (threadgroup_barriers). Make sure that all threads reach the barrier; otherwise, you can run into deadlocks or race conditions.Accuracy of Computations: The kernel seems to be doing fixed-point arithmetic. Be mindful of the precision and rounding errors that might accumulate.Logic for Condition Checks: For example, in the lines:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Make sure that the logic and conditions are correct. Check the parenthesis and order of operations.Inputs: Ensure that the input data passed to this kernel function is valid. Sometimes the issue might be with the data that is passed to the function rather than the function itself.Hardware Limitations: Make sure that you're not exceeding the hardware limitations of the device it is running on, especially regarding threadgroup sizes and memory usage.If after checking these points the issue still persists, I would recommend isolating the problematic section by using a process of elimination. You can try using simpler inputs, gradually commenting out code sections to see when it starts working, and print statements (or equivalent) to understand what is happening inside the kernel.",MERGED,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684#issuecomment-1585817943,comments.body,"@ikawrakow I asked GPT4 this problem in 2 ways.

First step first, then you ask me to move on to step two. Be very detailed, and VERY careful","ChatGPTAlright, let's proceed with analyzing this code in a structured manner. In this first step, I will focus on understanding the functionality and structure without pointing out potential issues yet. The code seems to be written using Apple's Metal Shading Language for GPUs.Function and Parameters: This function is a kernel meant to be run on a GPU, and it appears to perform matrix multiplication with 3-bit quantized values. The function takes in several inputs, including pointers to source data (src0 and src1), a destination buffer (dst), several constants, thread-specific parameters, and a buffer for intermediate sums (sum).Structure Definition: There is a struct called block_q3_k which seems to represent a quantized block of data. It contains:hmask which seems to store the high bit of quantized values (with 1/8th of QK_K elements).qs appears to store the lower 2 bits of quantized values (with 1/4th of QK_K elements).scales stores scale factors, quantized with 6 bits. It seems to have 3*QK_K/64 elements.d is a super-block scale represented as half-precision floating-point.Initial Definitions and Constants: After defining some constants (m1, m3, m4, kmask1, kmask2), it calculates nb by dividing ne00 by QK_K. It also computes several other values using thread information. These values seem to be used to determine the portion of the data that the current thread will process.Pointer Assignments: It sets pointers x and yy to sections of the input data, src0 and src1, respectively, based on the current thread.Loop over Data Blocks: The main computation is performed in a loop that iterates over data blocks. Inside this loop:It calculates a pointer y to a subsection of yy based on the loop variable and other constants.It calculates pointers q and hm to subsections of qs and hmask within the current x block.It performs some bit manipulation on the scales data.It accumulates a sum in a loop that iterates four times (for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k)), which seems to be calculating the product of quantized values and scales and accumulating the sum for each element in a block.It then accumulates this sum into sumf multiplied by the super-block scale dall.Store Sum in Thread Buffer: It stores sumf in the thread buffer sum at the index determined by thread position.Thread Synchronization and Accumulation: The following section of the code has three synchronization barriers followed by conditional sum accumulation. It seems to be performing a reduction operation across the threads in the threadgroup to accumulate their partial sums into a final sum.Store Final Sum in Destination Buffer: Finally, if the current thread is the first thread in the threadgroup, it takes the accumulated sum and stores it in the destination buffer dst.This first pass focused on understanding the structure and functionality of the code. The code is complex and highly parallelized, making use of various optimizations typical in GPU programming.Let me know if you would like me to proceed to the next step, where I can start pointing out potential issues or areas that need clarification.",MERGED,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684,https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684#issuecomment-1585817943,comments.body,"@ikawrakow I asked GPT4 this problem in 2 ways.

264,0,Why can’t I validate a self signed http tls certificate between two servers isolated from internet?,"ChatGPTWhen you have two servers isolated from the internet and want to validate a self-signed HTTP TLS certificate, there are a few reasons why it may not be possible:Lack of certificate authority: Self-signed certificates are not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). In an isolated environment, there may be no CA infrastructure available to validate the certificate's authenticity.Absence of certificate revocation checks: Certificate revocation checks require contacting the issuing CA or an online revocation list (CRL). Without internet connectivity, the servers won't be able to verify if the certificate has been revoked.Inability to perform certificate chain verification: When using a self-signed certificate, there is no certificate chain leading to a trusted root CA. Verifying the certificate chain requires access to the necessary intermediate and root certificates, which may not be available in an isolated environment.In such cases, self-signed certificates can still be used for securing the connection between the isolated servers, but the certificate's authenticity cannot be verified in the traditional way. It's important to ensure other security measures are in place, such as secure network communication and strong access controls, to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the connection.",MERGED,https://github.com/nickbabcock/OhmGraphite/pull/379,https://github.com/nickbabcock/OhmGraphite/pull/379#issuecomment-1616729656,comments.body,"https://chat.openai.com/share/0b9e90b1-2a60-43da-864e-eeef47d48fb2

265,0,I need to write a test for cypress where I'm testing uploading a torrent file to a website with a multipart form.

Generate a Torrent FileGenerating a torrent file dynamically within a Cypress test is not a straightforward task. The torrent file creation process usually involves reading a set of files and generating a metadata file (.torrent) with their information (including hashes for file integrity checking). This task is typically performed by a torrent client software, such as BitTorrent or uTorrent, or a library like create-torrent in Node.js.Cypress, however, doesn't support the fs module, which is used by create-torrent and other similar libraries to read files. This means you can't create torrent files dynamically within a Cypress test.As a workaround, you can generate a torrent file in advance and place it in the cypress/fixtures directory. You can use a library like create-torrent to generate this file, if necessary.2.

But I cannot use callbacks because of a Cypress restriction.

I've been discussing it with ChatGPT:

https://chat.openai.com/share/99d2ebdc-613c-4a84-8281-bfc2fe82bc14

And there are some alternatives:

### Option 1

Build our API service to generate torrent files on-the-fly. 

We can create a docker image for the service and add it to the docker composer configuration for the E2E testing environment.

### Option 2

Add that feature to the application. I would work only for tiny files. But It needs to make sense for the end-user. 

It would be something like this: https://kimbatt.github.io/torrent-creator/

Pros

- We do not need an extra service

Cons:

- In general, it's not useful for most users.

### Option 3

Use an independent env for each test, like in the backend. So there is no need to generate random data. We could always use the pre-built fixtures in the repo.

- Cons

I think it would be too slow with docker.

### Option 4

Delete the torrent after running the test. 

Cons:

- I have the impression that we could end up with a lot of inconsistencies. And test would also be slower because we have to clean the database after running them.

Pros:

- The database would always be clean, so no need to clean it from time to time in local dev env.

### Conclusion

The option suggested by ChatGPT seems to be easy to implement, and we do not need to add features to the app only for testing. Maybe it could be useful for other cases.

The MarshalJSON method first checks if ParametersRaw is non-nil. If it is, it uses ParametersRaw as the source for the ""parameters"" field in the JSON output. If ParametersRaw is nil, it marshals Parameters instead, and uses the result as the source for the ""parameters"" field.This is achieved by creating an anonymous struct with the same structure as FunctionDefine, but with a new Parameters field. This new field is of type json.RawMessage, which can hold a raw slice of bytes that is included as-is when marshaling to JSON.In the call to json.Marshal, the code passes a pointer to a new instance of this anonymous struct. It sets the Alias field to a new Alias (alias of FunctionDefine) instance pointing to fd, and sets the Parameters field to the parameters variable prepared earlier. As a result, the fields of fd (except ParametersRaw and Parameters) are included as-is in the JSON output, and the ""parameters"" field in the JSON output is sourced from either ParametersRaw or Parameters as appropriate.Note: the Alias is used to prevent infinite recursion in the MarshalJSON method.",MERGED,https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai/pull/377,https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai/pull/377#discussion_r1231538973,reviews.body,"heh, yeah, was a bit sad to see the release go out before I had a chance to upstream this. I agree it's a bit undesirable to have a breaking change like this, even if the release was only out for a few hours. 

It should be relatively straightforward to implement a custom marshaler here, but I think it's worth having the larger conversation about how this library intends to handle the Parameters field moving forward - will this library implement (and maintain) its own JSONSchemaDefine (and related structs) or not?

If so - then ParametersRaw is the only path forward, and I will write the custom functions. GPT-4 gets us pretty close I think: https://chat.openai.com/share/bec0bb09-41f5-4746-8b21-8e40087509b1

If not - then the cleanest path is to deprecate Parameters as an argument and ask people to use ParametersRaw. That's not the end of the world, but it would be much more intuitive to match the API schema. 

My view is that the JSON Schema definition is too large to reasonably support in this library and is better suited to be handled in a specialized library. The problem with supporting a subset is that once somebody hits an edge case, then they have to completely rewrite their code here to use either the raw bytes or another library's struct that can serialize properly.

It didn't find a duplicate and the similarity score was 1 for all. Some important words it picked are ""of"", ""on"", ""up"".  This needs improvement in prompt. The prompt is forcing chatGPT to reply with number, but chatGPT is not replying with a number, it is replying with this :

It strikes me that there's a key concept here which isn't being captured: that of a conversation.

ChatGPT has these - it calls them ""chats"". A chat is a bundle of ordered messages. They have an ID and an optional title (which ChatGPT picks itself but the user can then edit) - they are the units that can be shared, e.g. https://chat.openai.com/share/00d0ce07-deab-4d51-be84-e5e20aa07039 (a long-running conversation where I brainstormed names to use for this and other related concepts).

I thought about a bunch of different names for these - threads, sequences, chats - but I think I'm going to go with ""conversation"".

So a conversation is an ordered sequence of X - where X could be one of the following nouns:

- message
- response
- reply
- item
- round
- step
- completion

The challenge with picking this name is that at actually represents a pair: there's a prompt, and then there's the response from the LLM to that prompt. 

I think I'm going to say that a **conversation** is a collection of **completions**.

A prompt is always the first half of a completion (the response is the second half). That completion may end up comprising multiple messages - a system message, a user message, then an assistant message for example. The thing that makes it a completion is that it was sent to the LLM and the response from the LLM was then persisted.

In the common case of only running a single prompt (`llm ""three names for a pet skunk""` for example) that's still a conversation, it's just a conversation that ended after the first completion.

I think I log `conversations` and `completions` to the database - potentially via a plugin hook which will allow users to swap out alternative persistence layers, though that one can come later.

a) I have an idea for a new crate, run `cargo new`, pick a name since I have to, and reserve the name because I don't want to have to deal w/ renaming anything later. Of course, 90%+ of these ideas never get to the point of ""shipping"".
b) I am working in a space (e.g. tokio/async) and am carving out space. For `async-` there is/was a plan to release smaller crates, but for the most part that has been down prioritized. At the time, there was a race w/ other crates.io users to reserve as many `async-*` crate names as possible, so I was mostly just embracing the incentive structure of a single flat namespace.

That said, I still believe current behavior is just what will happen with a single flat namespace. I doubt any additional rules will stop me from reserving crate names.

What you can see is just a portion of that grid, which we're referring to as a ""viewport.""This square grid is labelled in a particular way: every cell has a number, starting with ""1"" at the top left corner, and increasing by one for each cell you move rightwards and downwards.

The ""5x5"" means that there are 5 cells horizontally (columns) and 5 cells vertically (rows). This is a way to determine the size of the unseen larger grid based on the highest index you can see in your viewport.To generalize this, if the largest cell index you see is N, then the grid is a square grid of size sqrt(N)xsqrt(N), and the total number of cells in the grid is N (or sqrt(N)*sqrt(N), which is the same thing). The sqrt(N) is the number of rows and also the number of columns, as the grid is a square.Please note that this applies when N is a perfect square (like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc).

### Eval name
viewport_to_grid_size

### Eval description
Evaluates a models ability to determine the size of an obscured grid using information only from initial constraints and a visible viewport.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Requires the model to go beyond simple instruction following to solve a task that requires pattern recognition and interpretation.

## Criteria for a good eval ✅

Below are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).

Your eval should be:

- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can  create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.
- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.
- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.
- [x] **Include at least 15 high quality examples.**

If there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.

### Unique eval value

## Eval structure 🏗️

Your eval should
- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`
- [x] Check that your yaml is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`
- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval

(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)

## Final checklist 👀

### Submission agreement

By contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies).

- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

### Email address validation

If your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the merged pull request.

- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.

### Limited availability acknowledgement

We know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.

- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access granted.

### Submit eval

- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form
- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data
- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push

Failure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.

### Eval JSON data

284,0,"Here is some rust code:

```
let conn =
    quiche::connect(Some(&server_name), &scid, local, peer, &mut config)?;
```

Is it possible to mutate the config's properties, after passing it into the `quiche::connect`?","ChatGPTIn the Rust programming language, whether or not you can mutate a value depends on its mutability and the kind of reference you have to it. In the code snippet you provided:[CODE_BLOCK_0]You're passing a mutable reference (&mut config) to the quiche::connect function, which means that this function can mutate the properties of config.However, after this function call, whether you can continue to mutate config in the calling code depends on what quiche::connect does internally:If quiche::connect consumes the mutable reference (i.e., stores it somewhere or uses it in a way that it becomes inaccessible), you cannot mutate config afterward in the calling code, at least until you regain ownership or another mutable reference.If quiche::connect only mutates config and then releases the mutable reference, you can continue to mutate config after the function call in the calling code.In the Rust documentation or the library's source code, it would typically mention if a function consumes its parameters, or otherwise has some unique ownership behavior. If the documentation or source code doesn't specify this behavior, the safe assumption is that after the function call completes, you regain the ability to mutate config in your code.To be certain about quiche::connect's behavior, you would need to consult the quiche library's documentation or source code.",MERGED,https://github.com/MatrixAI/Polykey/pull/552,https://github.com/MatrixAI/Polykey/pull/552#issuecomment-1685886831,comments.body,"So simply because `maxIdleTimeout` has to be continued to use, that is fundamentally the behaviour we will get, you can add a logger warning whenever the timeout is larger... but that might be too noisy.

Also if it turns out it's possible to actually mutate the config after you create the connection, that might actually solve the problem. I asked this but you need to experiment to see if it is true.
